Hey guys. I remember reading this one really interesting wetting/diaper story a few years back. I don't remember much of it but I'm hoping someone can help me out.

Stuff I remember:

- Very dark story, wouldn't say horror but its not a fun bubblegum story.

- takes place in modern times

- main character is a younger adult, I think 22-30

- the point of the story was something like a cursed pack of diapers that would never run out, but it slowly made her incontinent. The dark part of the story was that she couldn't get rid of them, and they'd cause weird nightmares and... Hallucinations?

- I do remember there was bedwetting and messing eventually

- one scene she was burying the pack in the backyard and then they ended up in the crotchety neighbour lady's yard

- maybe stuffed animals were involved?

- I can't remember what site I read it on. It was not on a forum type place, but something akin to deviantart or ararchive

- no idea how it ends

Any ideas?
