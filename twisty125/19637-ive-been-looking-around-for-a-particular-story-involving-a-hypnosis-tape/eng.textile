Hey everyone. I was hoping someone would know which story I'm talking about, I've been searching around for it.

The basic outline is, a man decides he wants to listen to a hypnosis tape that makes him wet the bed, and it goes through his life for the next while as he starts to lose total control as well. He meets a lady and is torn between being physical with her and her finding out about the diapers. In the end they get together because she's incontinent, and he ends up incontinent. The final scene is him finding out that there were 2 tapes, and he accidentally put the "incontinent" tape in, rather than the bedwetting one. It ends nicely and it's sort of heartwarming, in a weird way.

Any help? I want to say the story was called "The Tape" but I haven't found anything like that.

Thanks for any help!
