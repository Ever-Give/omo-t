Do I understand correctly that Julie's wetting incidents at home arose from proximity to Kathy's stash? So Kathy uses a part of the plant that spreads the control problem, but not the euphoria? Really parsing the story's details seems to require the (fictional I assume?) encyclopedia article.

There's some older family members that are the main culprits ðŸ™‚ You can use it to season food...

Hmmm. While searching for poppy flowering season, stumbled onto Callirhoe involucrata (purple poppymallow). Excepting its height, it looks like the flower I envisioned. The Latin name suggests it induces some involuntary action. Might work as a prop when Hollywood makes the movie version.

So late spring and early summer seem typical poppy flowering seasons. I've forgotten the season this story takes place. Doesn't matter.

Did I have a point??? Hmm. The story has established fantastic family interactions. Lots of potential. Does the nuclear family keep contact with other branches? Has anyone around the home neighborhood "benefited" from purple poppy? Hope the story continues.

The story is actually set during late spring. I mainly based it on Meconopsis napaulensis (Nepal poppy) though, because of its use as a psychedelic and put it in Bhutan (where many others of the same genus grow) instead of Nepal. As in, napaulensis and minginvitus are closely related (the actual phylogeny as well as the cause of the psychedelic effects of napaulensis are unknown afaik so I had some phylogenetically correct room to work with ðŸ˜›) as the main psychoactive poppies from the region. Look up what 'mingere' means in Latin and you know where the full name comes from ðŸ˜›

Glad to hear you liked it so much!

I love this work of you, and may I ask you to allow me to translate this work into Korean..? The site I want to upload is a Korean omorashi fan site( www.omoforum.com ). I am very happy that you rewrote the series and I am very looking forward to your another masterpiece.

Fine with me if you want to.

@ the others too, I have some kind of continuation of this lined up (which will get its own topic bc the weekend is over ðŸ˜› ) but having no idea how fast I will write and not being sure if I want to change some details later on I'm holding off on posting them. I'm at like 3 chapters and if you know how long I took finishing the 11 chapters in this one it might be a bad idea to start posting them now ðŸ˜…
