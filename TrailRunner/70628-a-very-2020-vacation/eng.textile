A Very 2020 Vacation

*000*2021-09-16 23:06

Zoe pressed her forehead against the car window, rolled her eyes, and let out a sigh. Her family's minivan, packed to the brim with luggage, coolers, and beach gear, sped down the highway. The sun beating through the window competing with the arctic breeze from the air conditioning made her feel both too hot and too cold at the same time. It was by the far the most miserable she'd ever felt going on a vacation.

The miseries had been mounting by the month, the week, the day, and now by the minute. She drew in a breath and held it, tightening her core and pulling her hips inward. She flexed one thigh and then the other, then back and forth again, ping-ponging quicker and quicker until she abruptly stopped. The tension in her bladder started rising two states ago and it was getting to the point where Zoe could only turn her focus elsewhere for a few seconds before the urge to pee interrupted again. Still, she thought, returning her breath to a normal cadence, any more bouncing of her legs and the whole car would know the situation. It was just something else to deal with, a perfectly logical continuation of the story of 2020.

For starters, the last three months of her senior year of high school took place entirely online, a situation that students and teachers alike each hated. Zoe had also spent the winter planning the perfect weekend for her 18th birthday. It had taken weeks to get her parents to agree to let her go down to the shore with her friends for a Friday and Saturday night, only winning them over by agreeing to also have the conservative backyard party her folks preferred on Sunday with relatives and neighbors.

Instead her birthday weekend turned into... well, any other weekend stuck inside with her parents and her siblings, except with a cheap grocery store cake. Her mother always, always made a cake from scratch for each and every one of their birthdays. But the grocery stores were completely sold out of flour, sugar, and vanilla as everyone decided to take up baking during quarantine. 17 birthdays for Zoe, 15 for Paige, and 13 for Chase. That was 44 birthdays, 44 freshly-baked cakes. Her brother had even gotten his in just under the wire, turning 13 in February before everything changed. 44 in a row, but Zoe's 18th birthday had broken the streak. Instead of the perfect birthday weekend there was no trip to the shore, a Zoom call with her friends that hardly took the place of a true celebration, and a mediocre cake to boot.

She turned her gaze from out the window over toward Paige, who was busy scrolling through her Instagram feed. This trip surely wasn't what she pictured for her 16th birthday -- there'd be no Sweet 16 party, and she'd also be limited to Zoom calls from friends -- but they were on their way to a fancy-schmancy beach house, plus she'd be getting a proper cake. The car was loaded up with coolers full of enough food to last them the week plus an entire bag of baking essentials to start a new cake streak.

Zoe pulled out her phone and tried to distract herself, but none of her friends posted anything interesting in the fifteen minutes since she'd last looked. With a bored sigh, she pulled her right leg up onto the seat and pressed her heel against her left thigh. As her body adjusted to the new sensation her desire for a bathroom dissipated, but only for a fleeting moment. The heaviness in her abdomen soon returned, lingering no matter where she moved her leg.

"Are we stopping anytime soon? Like for gas?" she decided to ask.

The second question came out as an almost involuntary deflection. She wasn't worried they wouldn't stop if she said she had to pee. Zoe was far too familiar with their "old fashioned" or "strict" ways -- the way she'd describe it would depend on how forgiving she felt at the moment -- but they wouldn't make her sit there with a full bladder and hold it in for no good reason.

No, it was more that she just didn't know like anybody knowing her business. That old trope about girls always going to the bathroom together? Zoe hated that. And if the girl insisted on sitting in the next stall over and talking the whole way through? Even worse. She didn't understand how anyone could actually relieve themselves under those circumstances but it happened often enough that she internalized that her pee shyness as the outlier. To her friends she was absent-minded, always leaving her bag behind when in truth she did it purposefully so that she could "remember" a few minutes later and pee in peace. Her friend Ally always joked that she needed to handcuff it to her wrist, taking it so far as buying her a toy pair as a gag gift.

Oh right, another misery: Last summer she let Ally talk her into signing up for one of those extreme obstacle course mud races. Like the A and Z at the beginning of their names, Ally and Zoe seemed like they couldn't be more different. Ally lived for sports, and when regular high school track and charity 5K runs stopped exciting her, she delved into the mud runs. Zoe, on the other hand, hated sports. She didn't hate the idea. It's just that her family adhered a little too closely to the old sexist tropes and so she grew up in the kitchen with her mother and not playing catch with her dad.

By the time she sought to fix this it was too late, she was too far behind. Gym class was routinely a nightmare and the one time she felt bold enough to step outside of her comfort zone ended in disaster: the sixth grade basketball tryouts, the one sport she thought her natural height advtantage might make up for the fact she could count on her fingers the number of times she'd shot a basketball in her life. Rather than seeing her as a future star who just needed to be molded, the coach not-so-subtly mentioned that the school play was also holding auditions and the yearbook committee was always looking for new members, too. And so that was the beginning and end of her athletic career.

Ally had been persistent, though, and with an eye toward getting in shape before she started college, Zoe agreed to sign up with her. She went with Ally to the track, to the gym, to the park, working all through the winter to get ready for the race in May. All that time spent being miserable on long runs and short sprints, getting herself in the best shape of her life -- okay, that wasn't saying much -- only to feel even more miserable when the race got canceled.

Her weight bounced back up more than a few pounds while there was practically nothing to do but sit inside and eat. Her height helped to disguise it and even at her heaviest only the select few bitchiest girls at school would call her fat. Still, she felt a lot better trying on clothes after her winter of working out than she ever had before. As she felt the waistband of her purple leggings pressing firmly against her skin she lamented the loss of progress and wished wished she'd worn one of her older, roomier pairs.

And of course Zoe recognized that none of these were truly miserable circumstances. Everyone she knew was healthy. Her family hadn't lost any income and wasn't facing eviction. A canceled race, no school graduation, and store-bought cake were not the worst things in the world. They were the minor inconveniences that most everybody was dealing with given the pandemic. But in a way that was its own brand of misery: Feeling bad because these exciting things were getting wiped out, and then feeling bad about feeling bad because, actually, things weren't so bad. Zoe hadn't come to any grand conclusions about this emotional conflict other than that the world is complicated.

"Wasn't planning on stopping for a while. still got almost a half-tank," her dad replied to her question, and Zoe's head returned from the clouds back into the car. Her swelling bladder counted as a legit concern, she decided, and being stuck in a car needing to relieve herself qualified her to feel slightly miserable. But she also didn't feel much like pressing the issue, putting the whole trip on pause just for her. She felt used to this sort of discomfort, waiting for the right moment to pee.

Irrational? Sure, she was aware of that. Ally had no problem announcing to a group full of strangers that she had to pee. She told stories about dashing just off the cross-country course to relieve herself. Zoe didn't even feel comfortable making the request around her own family. Were she still at home she would have gotten up and gone a while ago, but here she was trapped in her seat. Even the best car seat loses comfort a few hours in, doubly so with a full bladder. So she pressed her knees together and closed her eyes softly, as if she could simply relax away the building pressure.

Then her sister spoke up. "Well, can we?" Paige asked. "My foot's falling asleep and I have to pee."

Sure, Zoe thought, of course she had no issues with bringing it up either. But it was all the better that she did. Their dad bounced his head from side to side, doing the sort of Dad Math that road trips demand. Along with sealing in the juices and keeping a tidy lawn, making good time on a car ride is one of the pillars of fatherhood. He settled on a course of action.

"All right, we'll get to the bridge at the end of this road and make a stop there," he said. "Nicer bathrooms than these gas stations I bet, and a pretty nice view, too."

An ETA would have been nice, Zoe thought. She could pull her phone back out and punch it in on her GPS but it didn't sound like it would be too long a time. If someone had complained that they were hungry then he might have told them to remember to pack a protein bar next time and kept on driving, but Paige had said she needed a bathroom and he wouldn't ignore that. Zoe scooted back in the seat so that she could lean forward slightly to help with the urge. She glanced at Paige, who hadn't even registered their dad's response and was right back to her phone. Zoe wondered if she actually needed to go or if she was just bored.

The car rolled by a few more gas stations and Zoe had to agree they didn't look very appealing. Even as she started feeling the urge all the way down to her toes, where she flexed one set and then the other, she didn't feel too bad about skipping these places. She doubted they were taking extra cleaning measures because of the pandemic, mostly because "extra" implies there was some amount of cleaning going on to begin with.

Signs started to appear on the roadside about the upcoming bridge. 6 miles... 4 miles... 2 miles... Zoe started to already feel some measure of relief being so close. Mental relief, anyway. The signs clued her bladder into the sense that she'd be able to go soon and went into overdrive the way it does when you're dying for a pee and a toilet is near. So she had to really concentrate, really squeeze down all those muscles, while reminding herself that her body was just playing a trick on her.

The open road began to stack up with some traffic, a fact Zoe remained unaware of as her attention was focused inward. She was ready to be relaxed again, to sit in the car and zone out, to not calculate each movement of her legs. At the moment she had her feet off to the right side and knees pushed together over the left. Then the car hit a bump, threw off her delicate balance, and sent the urge to pee up a few notches. So she swung her feet and knees in the opposite direction.

The car slowed from 60 mph, down to 40, then 25, slow enough for Zoe to take note. Her internal clock told her they should be there by now but instead the car would lurch forward, brake, lurch forward, brake, dragging along but never coming to a complete stop. The motion of the car distressed her bladder all the more, the liquid inside drifting back and forth and causing new nerves to send signals of despair to her brain. Her dad shifted the car into the left lane and Zoe watched as the right line grinded to a stop.

"Looks like everyone's getting off there for some reason," her dad said. "You good to wait until we get across, Paige? There's another spot just like this on the other side of the bridge."

"Uh, yeah, sure," Paige answered. Zoe glanced over and noticed her sister shift her position after answering. I guess she isn't just bored, Zoe thought. Still, she could sense that Paige wasn't as far down the path as she was. Zoe groaned internally as the cycle continued: she had to pee, so thoughts of sitting on a toilet and letting it all go filled her mind... but those thoughts only intensified the urge.

The car rolled on, slowly now that the road converged into one lane over the bridge. Zoe looked out at the bay glistening in the sunlight, a pretty sight were it not for the fact that endless water was the last thing she wanted to focus on right now. Two things became quickly apparent: first of all, this wasn't the sort of bridge she expected. She couldn't see the other side, the road stretching as far as she could see, even looking like it disappeared at one point. Secondly, all those people exiting at the north end of the bridge seemed to know something her dad didn't because the car soon came to a complete stop with only brake lights ahead.

"Why aren't we moving?" her brother asked from the middle seat.

"I don't know, bud," her dad replied from the front. He turned to their mom. "Hun, can you check the GPS? It's usually not this bad this far away from the tunnel." Then he clicked off the air conditioning and rolled down the front windows, filling the minivan with the scent of the water. "Pretty cool view though, right?" he asked the rest of the car. "I always loved this part when we came this way when I was a kid. It starts as this bridge, then turns into a tunnel, then back into a bridge! Really cool, right?"

Zoe had no interest in the view. She sat up stiff in her seat in the back row and pulled up her phone, worried. She remembered the name of the bridge from the road signs and punched it in, pulling up the Wikipedia page. She felt her eyes start to bulge out of their sockets when she read the first sentence.

The Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel (CBBT) is a 17.6-mile (28.3 km) bridge–tunnel crossing at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, the Hampton Roads harbor, and nearby mouths of the James and Elizabeth rivers in the U.S. state of Virginia.

17.6 miles! She pulled both of her feet up onto the seat and pressed her knees together. Even if they were going 60 mph, it would take them 17 minutes to make it all the way across. And they were decidedly NOT going 60 mph. Every time they got even a little bit of speed they'd immediately have to slow down, often to a total stop. She wiped away a little bit of sweat that had started to form over her eyes and went to open her Maps app to see how long this was going to take, but her mom got there first.

"Slowdown on your route," she read from her phone's screen. "Red, red, red..." she narrated as she scrolled to trace the line on the map indicating heavy traffic. "Oh, it looks like it doesn't turn blue again until we're through the tunnel."

Zoe groaned, aloud this time, and tilted her head back in frustration. She could feel her stomach growing tight, the weightiness of her full bladder pushing against her other organs. She was used to a small level of discomfort that came with her preference for privacy, but she was willing to give that up when she needed to go like this. It's one thing to put it off ten more minutes in class rather than ask for a hall pass or to hold out until her sister or brother asked to stop. It was another thing to be stuck on this bridge, inching along, without the option of a bathroom no matter how willing she was to admit it.

Her groan and her feet on the seat caught the attention of her sister next to her. Zoe turned her head slightly, then quickly turned away before making eye contact. Too late.

"Wishing we would've stopped before the bridge?" Paige asked with a tiny grin. She had of course noticed her sister's slightly odd toilet habits over the years. She found it curious more than anything else and didn't bring it up much, but every now and then it was fun to poke at her older sister.

Zoe gave a non-committal shrug, but the way she dropped her feet back to the floor in an effort to look unconcerned told Paige all she needed to know.

"Yeah, me too," Paige said. "But at least I don't have to go like this." She lifted her own feet and mimicked an exaggerated version of Zoe's old position.

Their father saw in the rearview mirror and half-turned. "You okay back there, Paige? If I knew it was going to be like this I would've stopped back at the bathrooms before the bridge."

"Oh, I'll be okay until we stop," Paige replied, shifting back to normal. "Zoe's the one who really needs to go."

Zoe felt her cheeks heat up, getting drawn into precisely the kind of conversation she hated. "I'm fine, too," she said quickly, but she could tell with her core tightening to keep a hold on her swollen bladder that she didn't sound as non-chalant as her sister.

"Well you could have asked at any time and we would've stopped," her mom said. "Now you're just going to have to hold it. Brake lights!!" She pointed ahead frantically.

Zoe's dad quickly jammed the brake pedal to bring the van to a stop. Zoe clenched her jaw as she lurched foward, the seatbelt pressing hard against her waist. She let out an audible groan. The persistently growing dull ache, was turning more acute by the minute. Her bladder was no longer asking for relief, it was practically begging for it.

She tried to draw in some deep breaths and relax as they got moving again, but it felt like there wasn't even room inside her for her lungs to expand anymore. Just an ocean of pee inside her, stretching the walls of her bladder ever further. She had felt the nerves down there tingling before but now it felt like they were on fire.

She lifted her right leg over her left, pressing her thighs together and curling up her toes inside her sneakers. Her need to pee was becoming a full-body concern. The traffic moved -- slowly, but they were moving -- and Zoe stared out the window at some boats on the water in the distance, but her concentration was broken again and again by the pounding going on inside of her.

Zoe noticed the van coming up on a portion of the shoulder of the road widen with a sign marked "Emergency Pull Off." Two cars were parked there and as they passed by Zoe wondered if either was stopped for the kind of emergency she was experiencing. Her mind recoiled at the idea of having to pee on the side of the road. Or maybe, she realized with creeping dread, it was because that scenario was starting to become a possibility. She really, really needed to pee and this bridge seemed to go on forever. Before she could start rehearsing in her head a way to ask about it, she firmly reminded herself that emergencies were what little kids had, not girls her age.

She uncrossed and re-crossed her legs, careful not to turn her head and make eye contact with Paige because Zoe sensed how unnatural the movement must have looked. But everything needed to be done delicately, she thought, to maintain order and balance within herself. It felt like one wrong move was going to make her burst.

Out the front of the window she spotted a sign over the road: TUNNEL 1 MILE AHEAD. She let out a long exhale. That's when the traffic would really start moving again and even that would be a win. It was the slow crawl of traffic that was the torture, the knowledge that if things were moving normally they'd already be back on the road after a stop. But instead her urgently-needed toilet break was just Out There in the future, delayed for no good reason.

Zoe couldn't sit up straight anymore without a searing reminder in her abdomen, so she leaned forward slightly up against the tension of the seatbelt, her legs still firmly crossed. She could see the flashing lights from a siren as her family's van finally arrived near the incident that holding everybody up. They slowed one final time to pass narrowly by the police car and the broken-down car it was trying to assist, hood open.

"Finally," her dad said as he hit the gas. "Shouldn't be too much longer from here," he announced to the rest of the car.

They reached the tunnel and Zoe took advantage of the dimmer light to press her hand between her thighs, to finally push back against the immense pressure. Her chest still felt tight but she cherished the moment of relief until the pounding of her overfull bladder returned all too soon.

The tunnel ramped up and daylight filled the van again. They were back above the water, zipping along now. Zoe released her hand from between her thighs. She closed her eyes, imagining a superpower where she could simply wish away the demanding impusle. But with a thumping wave of pressure, her body reminded her she was merely human. All that pee stored inside of her was going to have to go somewhere, and soon.

Zoe started to remember the one time her toilet shyness had almost gotten her into serious trouble: freshman year, gym class. She'd been held up by a teacher in her biology class and rushed to get changed so she could pee before going out to the softball field. But a group of older girls were around the toilets and so she decided to wait until after and use the bathroom closer to her next class which she'd found to be less crowded.

And so she did, successfully making it through a softball game without once fielding or throwing a ball. Walking back toward the school she felt her need to pee was about as bad as she would let it get and that maybe she'd use the toilet in the changing room anyway. That's when the fire alarms went off.

Her class stopped outside while the rest of the school emptied out. Zoe waited, waited, waited for the fire drill to end and to be let back in, growing more and more desperate. Word got around that this wasn't a fire drill. Someone said there was a fire in the cafeteria. Someone else said that wasn't true and someone must've just pulled the alarm. She didn't care about the particulars, she was just interested in getting to a toilet.

It took almost all of the next class period, 45 minutes, for a fire truck to finally show up. That was 45 minutes of standing around, no distractions, just an ache that got worse and worse until her legs were bouncing and...

In the van, she stopped daydreaming to realize that her legs were bouncing right now. This was getting to be worse than that day. Plus she had seen a couple of guys and at least one girl dash into the woods adjacent to the school. It was quite apparent why, and while the thought of half the school seeing her make that trek to relieve herself horrified her, she had just started to consider it when the fire marshal gave the all-clear, the bells rang, and students were let back in. She made a beeline for the stalls and practically melted with relief as she sat down.

At least that day there was another option, as much as she detested it. Now they were on a one-lane bridge with no shoulder. She had to pee so bad and her only choice was to wait, to hold it all back.

She thought she was having déjà vu when she looked out the front and saw a sign: TUNNEL 1 MILE AHEAD

"There's another tunnel?!" she asked, her exasperation getting the best of her.

"Yes, but we're almost there," her mother replied. "Look, you can see the main land over there. Just keep holding it, okay?"

Zoe bit down hard on her lip, partially from embarrassment and partially because she needed somewhere to direct her increasingly nervous energy. For a brief moment her body was able to focus on that sensation, but the throbbing need to pee quickly interceded and washed back over her.

They dipped down into the second tunnel and this time Zoe bent forward and buried both hands between her legs, shoving them against her pee hole. God, I have to pee SO bad, she thought to herself. Her cheeks were hot and there were beads of sweat on her forehead and along the waistband of her leggings, but she felt goosebumps pop up on her arms and a cold shiver ran through her.

The car emerged and Paige looked over to see her sister in dire need of relief. She'd certainly never seen Zoe like this, and come to think of it, she couldn't really remember anyone looking quite so desperate. Well, except for maybe Kinsley, their 3 year old cousin who was just starting to master potty training the last time they'd seen her. Paige stifled a smile at the thought of Zoe being reminded to use the potty and turned away.

Zoe pulled her hands out and pushed against the seat with stiff arms. Some parts of her body were growing numb but the searing anguish was only becoming more acute. She uncrossed her legs and almost immediately they started to jiggle wildly up and down. With a great effort she managed to reduce it to a quiver, but she had to pee so, SO bad that she was losing control over herself. She pushed her butt back down against the seat, still bent over in agony.

Her heart seemed to jump up into her throat as the van slowed again. Zoe looked up, terrified of more traffic, but saw the tollbooth instead. Her legs started dancing all on their own again. She had to pee worse than she'd ever had to in her entire life, but she had made it over the bridge. She didn't even bother to try and stop her bouncing thighs. She was SO close.

The van rolled off the exit ramp and into a parking lot. Zoe was singularly focused on holding back the ocean of pee inside of her and stem the ever-rising tide. They slipped into a parking space and she undid her seatbelt. With the fabric no longer digging into her waist she sensed a brief reprieve from the pressure, but that disappeared as soon as she darted out the side door.

A roaring spasm shocked her body and she had no choice but to quickly grab herself to prevent an eruption. Her mom stepped out of the front passenger door just in time to see.

"For God's sake, Zoe, keep it together," she said disapprovingly. Sure, the traffic was terrible and she was looking forward to relieving herself too but she couldn't quite believe her oldest daughter had let it get this bad. "I'm going to go get some food for the rest of the drive while you and your sister run off to the bathroom. What about you, Chase, are you hungry or do you need to pee first, too?"

Zoe didn't wait around for her brother's answer and instead started beelining it toward the building with the bathrooms. Paige followed behind while her parents and brother went toward the building on the opposite side of the parking lot.

Every step seemed to magnify the pressure tenfold. She could only manage the shortest of breaths as the the weight of all that pee pushing down was becoming completely unbearable. She was DYING to get to a toilet. Her vulva was pounding with a tension she wouldn't have been able to imagine if she weren't living through it.

She made it halfway there before glancing over at her sister and noticing something on her wrist. Oh, FUCK. She froze.

"Oh god I forgot my mask...! Oh god PLEASE let me borrow yours and go and you can get mine from the car, please!" She pleaded.

"Come on, I have to pee, too." Paige protested.

"Not this bad, I swear to God, PLEASE!" Zoe was doubled over. "I'm seriously about to pee in my pants, I can't go all the way back to the car, please!"

Paige gave a sigh and pulled her mask off her wrist and handed it to Zoe, who grabbed it and took off like a relay racer. "Thank you thank you thank you!" She called as she took off once again, while Paige turned around to track down her parents to get the keys.

Zoe came up to the building, slipped on her mask and pranced through the doors, looking around frantically. To the left was a bank of what used to be pay phone; to the right she saw the sign for the restrooms. She passed by the men's room, sheepishly looking at the ground to avoid the stares she knew she was getting. There was no hiding it, her jagged walk a telltale sign of her frantic desperation.

She rounded the corner and nearly burst into tears. There was a line down the hallway of nearly 20 women. No, no, NO! She had made it all this way, waited and waited, held it and held it. There was no way she was going to be able to make it through a line this long. She collapsed her weight against the wall and dug her hand into her crotch again. She HAD to hold it, she thought to herself. There was no other choice.

The line had hardly moved by the time Paige caught up. "Jesus, this line sucks," Paige said. "I guess a lot of people really needed to go after all that traffic."

"You seriously have NO idea how bad I have to go right now," Zoe said nervously. "I can't even, like, I can't even think right now, I have to PEE!" She was keeping her legs stiff, muscles clenched, but they were getting wobbly all on their own, exhausted from the task of holding back so much pee.

Paige pulled her phone out of her pocket. "Hey, mom just texted." She paused. "Here, look!" She added with some giddiness.

It took Zoe a second to be able to focus her eyes on the screen. She read: "Almost no line for the family bathroom over here."

"Should we go?" Paige asked.

Zoe looked helplessly at the line in front of her. "I don't even know if I can move without peeing..."

"Come on, this line is going to take forever. You can make it," Paige said.

Zoe pushed her weight off the wall and her knees buckled. She gave the line more look. "Fuhhhhhh-" Another spasm caused her to shiver. "Fine, okay, let's go."

Zoe honestly wasn't sure she could take another five steps without losing control but somehow she managed to stumble back outside the building. Her bladder was screaming in agony, desperate beyond belief to push out a torrent of hot pee. She had to pause and grab herself yet again, a split-second away from a drop escaping.

"You could just pee between cars," Paige offered, slightly impressed that Zoe had managed to make it even this long.

Zoe felt more than ready for that. She wasn't sure where her bathroom anxiety went. She wasn't even sure if two plus two equaled four. Right now the only thing she was absolutely certain about was that she was at her absolute limit and needed to pee RIGHT NOW.

"Oh wait," Paige said. "There's like, cops all around."

Zoe let out a loud, embittered sigh. Wave after wave of pressure was engulfing her body as she came closer and closer to gushing pee into her underwear. With actual tears filling her eyes, she started across the parking lot. She could barely lift her feet off the ground, nearly dragging them the entire way. Paige opened up the door and Zoe hopped inside.

Her gaze immediately found the bathroom. A mother was exiting with her toddler son and another went in. There was only one other person on line, a young mother with a baby in a carrier strapped in and a diaper bag in her hand. Zoe managed to shuffle her way over and stood behind them. She wiped her eyes dry and then grabbed herself with both hands, launching into a full-on peepee dance. This was it, she was SO close but god she had to pee SO bad. Her bladder was pulsing and her heart was pounding as beneath her mask she chewed on her lower lip.

Her vulva and her thighs were burning, past their breaking point and begging to give up. Her body was defeated and revolting against her, and it was only pure will was keeping Zoe from soaking her legging with pee. Her bladder was contracting, trying to squeeze it out, but by some miracle she found a way to draw it back in. Then she heard some footsteps behind her, and a voice.

"This is NOT how a girl your age acts, Savannah! Do you understand me?!"

Zoe turned to see a very angry-looking mother scolding a girl who looked to be about 9 or 10. Zoe could only see the girl's eyes above her mask but the sheer horror in them told the story. That and the hand wedged between her legs. Zoe couldn't bear to look at anyone else as desperate to pee as she was so she turned away, but the mother's running commentary behind them was somehow worse.

"You'd better be keeping those panties dry or else you're going to be in big trouble, Savannah! Am I clear?"

"Yes, mommy."

"We went through this on our trip to Granny's last winter, didn't we? You're going to be in 5th grade next year but if you act like a preschooler there are going to be consesquences. I made that clear, didn't I?"

"Yes."

"Good. So you're going to be a good girl and keep your panties dry?"

Zoe grabbed herself even harder. She couldn't imagine how Savannah must have been feeling. It was almost impossible to hold it all in as it was. She grinded her thighs together around her hand as hard as she could. If someone was lecturing her like this she was pretty certain she wouldn't be able to do it.

"Yes!" The girl exclaimed, but Zoe could tell how unconfident she sounded.

"Or else-"

"Mom, please!"

The mom ignored the protest. "Or else I'm going to have to get you some more peepee pullups. Is that what you want?" A few seconds passed. "You answer me when I ask you a question, Savannah! Do you want to wear big girl panties or peepee pullups?"

Zoe half-turned and saw the mortified girl covering her face with the one hand she had free. "Big girl panties," she could just barely hear the muffled reply.

Zoe gave Paige a look and titled her head toward the younger girl. She couldn't believe she was about to do this, but her heart was aching for this poor girl. Zoe balled her fists and dug her fingernails into her palms, then turned around fully.

"Um, do you want to go ahead of us?" she asked.

It was apparent the mother had been too caught up in her own world to notice Zoe's obvious distress. "Yes, that would be great," she replied matter-of-factly, taking Savannah's wrist and leading her in front of Zoe and Paige. Paige stared at her sister, keeled over and grabbing herself once again, in shock.

The door opened and the mother with the baby carrier started toward it. The other mother stepped forward too.

"Would it be too much trouble if we jumped ahead?" she asked.

The mother with the carrier turned and, noticing Savannah with her legs crossed tightly, gave a sympathetic look, then pointed to the carrier. "Sorry, but no, I've really got to get my baby changed and get back on the road." With that, she went in and closed the door.

"Okay, Savannah," the other mother turned back to her daughter. "Keep holding it. I better not see one single drop of pee in your undies when we go in there!"

Paige turned and looked at Zoe. "What a bitch," she muttered. The mom turned and scowled and both of them, but was unable to tell who had said it.

For Zoe it was beyond discomfort, beyond unpleasant, beyond misery. It was absolute torture, all that pee forcing its way down to the very tip of her vulva. She couldn't summon the might to keep her legs the least bit steady. She had to pee so bad that her ears were ringing. Every single fiber of her being was breaking down, unable to withstand the throbbing of her bladder.

Her eyes welled with tears once again. She was squeezing her muscles as hard as she could but they were simply exhausted and she could feel her grip slipping. Her abs were so sore it hurt to breathe. She stood doubled over, fingers pushing hard against her pee hole, but it was feeling hopeless. The spasms were no longer coming in waves, it was more like one constant contraction that was overtaking her.

Watching the girl in front of her bounce around made it even worse. Zoe regretted letting her go ahead of her. She started wondering what would happen if Savannah DID have an accident. Maybe her mom would angrily pull her aside and Zoe would get to go after all. She thought she heard Savannah gasp and looked on, wondering if she'd see a stain. But instead she just continued on fighting what Zoe knew all too well was a furious, delirious need to pee.

The door once again clicked open and out came the mother with the baby carrier. Zoe looked in and this time caught a glimpse of the toilet as Savannah and her mother raced in. That sight, the idea that she was THIS close to the relief that she'd longed for, sent her mind over the edge.

"I can't do it," she said, her body trembling. "I don't think I can hold it."

"Yeah you can, you're so close," Paige encouraged.

"No, seriously, I can't hold it! I have to pee I have to pee I have to PEEEEEEE!" Zoe's eyes filled with tears of pure torment. Her bladder throbbed so violently she felt it in her toes. A jet of hot pee shot down and even with both hands pressing back she was powerless to stop it from gushing out and saturating her underwear.

"Oh god, it's coming, it's coming!" Zoe bit down on her bottom lip so hard she nearly drew blood. Her body had felt a microscopic tinge of relief and it was demanding more. It all burned with relentless force, another surge of pee shooting straight through her defenses. Her vulva was hot with tension but she could still feel the effect of the warm pee in her panties.

"I can't, I can't..." she choked out in a high-pitched squeal, feeling more and more helpless. She was rapidly losing control of her body. A trickle of pee started anew and Zoe felt it grow to a full-on stream, rapidly soaking her underwear. She managed to cut it off but the urge was so overwhelming and her legs were growing so weak she had to hold one arm out for balance. Her right hand remained buried between her legs, her sweaty fingers realizing a different moisture.

Paige looked to her sister with alarm. "You're so close! Keep holding, keep holding!" She stood in astonishment as another rush of pee poured out, instantly staining the front of her sister's leggings. "Oh my god, you're actually peeing your pants!"

Zoe's chest shuddered with raw embarrassment. She couldn't do this. Not right here. Not right now. She rejected the very notion that she could be standing here, 18 years old, having an accident in her pants. It seemed so impossible and yet she felt another convulsion and her thighs burn with sizzling pee once again.

She stumbled forward toward the bathroom door and pounded it on. "Please hurry," she whimpered. "Please hurry up!"

She heard an echoey voice from inside. "-back in pullups because you can't keep your panties dry like a big girl!"

Zoe moaned in agony. Her mind seemed to give up. She hadn't been able to keep her panties dry. She stepped back from the door and rocked back and forth, bent at the knees and doubled over. She had nothing left to give, no strength left. A torrential wave of scorching pee exploded from her, causing a giant stain to spread across her wide butt.

Paige stood, mouth agape beneath her mask, watching her older sister lose the battle. This was making her own need to pee start to feel urgent. Another eruption of pee came and with Zoe's inner thighs and butt already drenched, droplets splashed onto the floor.

Zoe's lips were trembling in horror of the real-life nightmare she was powerless to stop. Her fingers pushed against herself in abject vain. More pee burst out of her and stained the entire left thigh of her leggings in a flash. Her last defense fell and she started peeing so forcefully it stung. The volume of it all was too great for her urethra and it began to hiss as it poured out, drowning her underwear and leggings. The stain spread until hardly any of the original light purple color remained, replaced with a dark, soggy violet.

She tried to clamp down but her muscles were too exhausted to respond. The stream slowed for three seconds only to erupt again, flowing all the way down her legs, dripping off her feet, and widening the puddle beneath her.

She looked up, the immediately turned away. Her mom, dad, and brother were walking over with their food. She couldn't stand to make eye contact with anyone. The hissing ceased and the stinging torrent finally began to slow, but she was still wetting her pants as she turned around to see her mom.

"Zoe... oh my GOD!"

The bathroom door opened behind her and Paige dashed in, grabbing herself. Savannah looked up at Zoe with puffy red eyes, while her mother led her away by the wrist. "Looks like you're not the only one who needs more potty training," she said to her daughter. Zoe dropped her head, staring directly at the yellow pond she'd created.

2020. What a miserable year.

I have a n idea for a Part II, but considering I started writing this over a year ago... who knows when that might come.

Thank you everyone, I'm glad you all enjoyed it. I have... not starting writing anything else yet. But I will at some point!
