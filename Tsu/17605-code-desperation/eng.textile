Code: Desperation

*000*2013-10-22 18:23

As I mentioned in my intro topic, I'm quite a fan of the old cartoon, Code Lyoko, along with its continuation, Code Lyoko Evolution. Sadly, I've seen very few pee-related fics about CL (none on this site). So I took it upon myself to write myself a few fics based on ideas I had for such scenarios, especially since the show gives so much to work with.

I've made five so far with plenty more ideas to come. The first five will be made in one post, each under a spoiler tag for the sake of organization. Every story after that will be made as a separate post on this topic.

Includes underage characters, but nothing sexualized.

I'm open to all concrit and ideas, especially given that I'm not the best writer. So without further ado.

Chapter 1: Yumi In the Garden

{{:

Yumi was on her way back from Kadic. As a day student, she only lived a short distance from her house and thus could get there with ease just by walking. She knew her route well and knew where not to go if she was to avoid any danger. Plus, she was a Lyoko Warrior, whatever danger came her way, she could defend herself no problem. However, as she was walking home, she noticed something that couldn’t be avoided; something that had to be taken care of, and it was signaled by that oh so familiar feeling in her bladder.

‘Damn.’ Yumi cursed under her breath. ‘I knew I should’ve gone before I left.’

She had to go to the bathroom since this morning. Unfortunately, after a whole day of being almost late for class, multiple tests, unrelenting teachers, a lunch period with her friends, she had completely forgotten to relieve herself all day. It also didn’t help that there was a XANA attack in the middle of the day to completely throw her off schedule.

She quickly made her way to her house, the pain in her bladder getting slightly worse by the minute, she ran faster until she reached it five minutes later. She walked up to the house, symbolized by the cherry blossom tree in the front yard and the slight Japanese theme to it, unlocked the door with her spare key, entered and shut and locked the door behind her.

Yumi then made her way to the bathroom door and tried to turn the knob, only to find that the door was locked. She then knocked on the door to see who was inside.

“What is it?” A voice said. She recognized it as her little brother, Hiroki.

“Open up, I need to use the toilet.” Yumi said.

“Oh, sorry, Yumi.” Hiroki said. “I’m in the bath. I’m gonna be a while.”

“You pick now of all times to take a bath?” Yumi asked.

“I couldn’t take one this morning without being late.” Hiroki said. “I decided to take it as soon as I got back otherwise I’d end up forgetting if I put it off too long.”

“What?” Yumi said. “Can’t you get off for like thirty seconds?”

“No can do. I was here first.” Hiroki said stubbornly. “You can wait until I’m done.”

“Come on.” Yumi exclaimed. “I really have to pee.”

“Not my problem.” Hiroki said.

Yumi knew this wasn’t going anywhere. As luck would have it, the only bathroom in the house just had to be occupied when she hadn’t gone all day. As her desperation got worse, she could only sit and lean against the wall with her legs crossed, struggling to keep her pent-up urine from releasing and causing an accident. She was too old for that; if Hiroki or her parents found out about that, she’d never hear the end of it.

Minutes passed. Her urge to urinate only grew as Hiroki showed no signs of being done.

“I can’t take this.” Yumi said to herself. “I have to pee and I can’t last much longer. I’ll just have to improvise.”

Yumi carefully got herself up from the floor, trying oh so hard not to wet herself. Once she was standing up, she then grasped her crotch with both hands and made her way around the house, hoping to find something to relieve herself in.

She first noticed a large potted plant in the corner of the hallway.

‘No, that won’t do.’ Yumi thought to herself. ‘We just watered that and if someone, heaven forbid Mom or Dad if they come home early, were to notice a puddle, they would suspect something.’

Yumi kept searching. She went to the kitchen and noticed the sink. She briefly considered doing her business there, but she decided against it.

‘What if the smell stayed?’ Yumi thought. ‘Even Hiroki would recognize it.’

As the pain in her bladder got worse, she knew that she had only one option at this point. With as much speed as she could go without losing control, she made her way to the back door and out into the backyard. With her legs still folded and fidgeting greatly, she examined the yard and considered her options. Yumi knew that she wasn’t allowed to use the yard as a toilet; she and Hiroki would do it when they were a lot younger, but her mom made Hiroki and her give up that habit as they got older.

But there was no time to worry about that. When you have to pee, you have to pee. And Yumi really had to pee.

Luckily for her, the yard was fenced off so there was no chance of anyone accidentally sneaking a peek from next door. She made her way to the edge of the fence, unbuttoned and unzipped her black jeans and pushed them down to her knees along with her red panties. She then squatted down over some flowers that her family planted alongside the fence and relaxed.

At first nothing, but after a few seconds, a small trickle of urine escaped her urethra and grew into a large stream. The area around her was permeated with the pleasant sound and warm aroma of her pee stream hitting the dirt and flowers, creating a foamy puddle in the dirt and soaking the heads of the flowers with her golden offerings.

“Aaahhh…” Yumi said to herself as she was still urinating at full force. “Oh God, that feels so good.”

After nearly a full minute, her stream began to die down. After getting out the last spurts of urine, she plucked a leaf from a nearby bush, wiped herself, placed it in the pee-soaked garden and pulled up her lower garments. She turned to head back to the house only to find that Hiroki was sitting right in front of the door, eyes wide and blushing.

“How much did…?” Yumi asked.

“The whole thing.” Hiroki said. “Don’t worry, I won’t tell if you won’t tell.”

“Thanks.” Yumi said. With that, they headed back in ready to put this whole thing behind them.

Chapter 2: The Contest

{{:

It was lunchtime at Kadic Academy. Yumi was sitting at her usual place with her friends at the cafeteria, eating lunch and conversing about the usual things, mostly about Lyoko and what XANA has planning this time. With the lunch period wrapping up, Jeremie stood up and walked away.

“Where are you off to?” Yumi asked.

“I thought I’d head down to the factory and test out a new program I had for the virtual ship.” Jeremie said.

“I’ll come with you.” Aelita said.

“That’s quite alright.” Jeremie said. “For once, I don’t require your assistance for this particular part. Besides, don’t you have a quiz today?”

“We should go too.” Ulrich said.

“Yeah.” Odd said. “We promised Jim we’d help out getting track and field stuff ready before class starts. See ya, Princess.”

“Alright then.” Aelita said.

As the three boys left, Yumi and Aelita began to take their trays out and make their way to class when they were stopped by none other than Sissi.

“Oh, hello Yumi.” She said.

“If you’re looking for Ulrich, forget it.” Yumi said annoyed. “He just left.”

“Can’t I just talk to a fellow friend without it having to do with my Ulrich-dear?”

“What do you want?” Yumi asked.

“I just thought since both you and Ms. Einstein were here, I’d offer some kind of proposal.”

“What do you mean?”

“I want to have a little contest with you.” Sissi said. “Just between us three.”

“Sissi, we don’t have time for this.” Aelita said

“Lemme finish.” Sissi said. “If you win, I promise I won’t chase after Ulrich or bother any of you. Lose, and you’ll have to let Ulrich go on a date with me.”

“A chance to have you off our backs?” Yumi asked. “Sure, why not?”

“And even if we lose, we won’t be any worse off than we are now.” Aelita added.

“Perfect.” Sissi said.

“So what kind of contest is this?” Aelita asked.

“Water drinking.” Sissi said pulling out three pitchers of water from underneath a table.

“What? No way!” Yumi exclaimed. “This is just another of your stupid attempts to humiliate us.”

“So you forfeit?” Sissi said.

“I didn’t say that.” Yumi said. “And I’m definitely one to not back down from a challenge.”

“Good.” Sissi and the others then sat down as she gave a pitcher to each person. She then placed a series of cups on the table.

“Alright, the goal is to drink the entire pitcher of water without leaving your seat.” Sissi said. “You can take as much time as needed. However, if you wet yourself, you lose. The last person to go to the bathroom wins.”

“Sounds fair to me.” Yumi said.

“Alright, ready?” Sissi said. “Go!”

Each of the three began filling their cups up with water and drank cup after cup. After a minute, a somewhat familiar face interrupted them.

“Hey guys.” Said a tall, black girl. It was Sam, Odd’s old girlfriend.

“Sam? What are you doing here?” Yumi asked. “You don’t go to this school.”

“I wanted to give Odd this new CD I made for him, but seeing as you’re the only three here I guess I’m a bit too late.” Sam said. “So what are you guys doing?”

“Water drinking contest.” Aelita said.

“Oh cool. Can I join?” Sam asked. “I love contests and I never lose.”

“Sure.” Sissi said. “You can use my pitcher when I’m done.”

“Sweet.” Sam said. “Prepare to lose.”

Each girl continued to drink from the large pitchers until Sam’s was the only one with still some water. Sam poured the last part into her cup and took a huge swig.

“There we go.” Sam said. “So who wins?”

“Whoever’s last to pee without wetting themselves.”

“Excellent.” Sam said. “So it looks like…”

“You four!” They heard a voice shout.

“Uh oh.” Yumi said recognizing the voice as Jim.

“In case you forgotten, class started five minutes ago!” Jim shouted. “And here I find you goofing off in the lunchroom with your friends.”

“But…”

“You three, four hours detention in the library, pronto!” Jim said. He then turned to Sam. “As for you, this cafeteria is for Kadic students and faculty only. You are to leave these premises before I call your parents.”

“Yes sir.” Samantha said.

“Looks like she forfeits.” Sissi said. “Now it’s just the three of us.”

As detention went by, the girls began to grow increasingly desperate. All the water they had drank had now taken its toll and their bladders were all close to bursting. The three girls then decided to head off to the nearest girls’ bathroom to get ready for the final part of the test. All three girls were already either crossing their legs or holding their crotches in desperation as their urge grew and grew.

“Alright, since you all made it this far, it’s time to see how much longer you can last.” Sissi said. “As you can see, there are three stalls available; however, the one in the middle here is the only one that is usable. The two on the sides just so happen to be out of order.”

“Alright, let’s hurry up.” Aelita said hopping up and down in desperation. “I’ve never had to pee so badly in my life.”

“Again, whoever pees last in the toilet wins.” Sissi said. “Pee yourself and you lose no matter the circumstances. Understand?”

“Yes.” Yumi said. She then turned to Aelita. “Aelita, since there’s two of us, one of us should go first. You should be the one to go, you seem the most desperate.”

“No.” Aelita said. “It’s unfair to keep you waiting when you’ve been drinking faster than me.”

“Fine.” Yumi said squeezing her legs shut as her bladder ached for release. “But only because there’s no sense arguing about it. I have to pee, and I’ll be damned if either of us lose to Sissi.”

Yumi then, with her legs still clamped together, hopped her way into the toilet stall and locked the door. Now using only her Kegel muscles to keep herself from leaking, she unbuttoned her pants, yanked them down with her underwear and sat down. Within a second, her pee shot out full force and made contact with the water. Yumi just closed her eyes and sighed in relief as the sound of urine hitting the water filled the room. On the other side of the stall door, something happened to Sissi that she never counted on: Hearing Yumi peeing and sighing in relief unsurprisingly made Sissi’s bladder more desperate for release.

‘I’m not gonna lose it. I’m not gonna lose it. I’m not gonna lose it.’ Sissi repeated to herself in her head as she grabbed her crotch and kept hopping up and down.

Aelita, meanwhile, was still struggling to hold the contents of her bladder in. For such a petite girl, she was doing a fine job in maintaining her composure: She just hands covering her private area like Sissi, but she hadn’t begun to fidget like her.

Back in the toilet stall, Yumi’s pee stream had finally subsided, with nothing more than a few drops coming out and hitting the toilet. Yumi looked down between her legs and at the water below and was amazed by how much she had peed. She then looked at her vagina and saw the scattered droplets of pee on her black pubic hair. She then grabbed a couple squares of toilet paper, wiped her vagina, pulled up her underwear and pants and flushed the toilet. (A/N: And yes, you anatomical nitpickers, I’m fully aware that the correct term is vulva and not vagina. However, I’ve always used the two interchangeably and I’m not going to stop now. Besides, vagina just sounds more innocent).

After unlocking the door, Sissi then burst in and made her way to the toilet and locked the door.

“Sissi, what about your date with Ulrich?” Aelita asked.

“It’s not worth it!” Sissi shouted. “My reputation is at stake; if I end up leaking all over myself, I’ll never hear the end of it.”

“Well, hurry up.” Aelita said getting even more and more desperate.

Sissi then unbuttoned her trousers, slid them down with her panties and hiked up her skirt, exposing her own vagina, complete with a triangle of black pubic hair not unlike Yumi’s. She then sat down and relieved her bladder.

‘Oh God…’ She thought to herself as she sighed and became immersed in the melodious tinkling sound of the two liquids meeting. ‘I have to admit, after holding it in for so long, it really does feel good to finally go tinkle. I should try holding it in more often.’

At that same time, Sam was still walking home from Kadic. All the liquids she had drank were taking its toll. With her hands covering her crotch, she desperately tried to make her way home without having an accident in her favorite skirt. Even though she was already in her neighborhood, she still had such a long way to go (at least longer than her bladder can hold).

“At this rate, I’m gonna pee myself for sure. Ohhh.” She moaned holding herself and doing a potty dance.

Immediately, she looked over at a nearby alleyway and saw a large dumpster near the wall; there was just enough space between it and the wall for her to sneak behind. Sam contemplated this option; she was always told as a little girl that if she had a potty emergency and there was no place to go, she was more than welcome to go pee behind a bush or dumpster. But she wasn’t a little girl anymore; she was too old to regress to something like that.

‘Screw it.’ She thought. ‘We’re all animals anyway; we should be allowed to pee wherever when nature makes its call.’

As she hobbled into the alleyway, she looked both ways to make sure nobody was walking around. When she was sure the coast was clear, she scooted behind the dumpster, lowered her pants and underwear to her knees, squatted down on the pavement and hiked her skirt up, showing her vagina and unkempt black pubic hair (so much that her slit was completely covered and not one inch of skin in her bikini area was showing; she was truly ‘au-natural.’) to the rest of the world.

She just relaxed and suddenly a large stream of pee shot out of her urethra and splattered all over the pavement below her. She just moaned in relief and euphoria as her thick stream left her aching bladder and made contact with the pavement with a loud pitter-pitter-patter, forming a large, foamy puddle (an obvious sign of rapid release after being stored up for so long) that flowed down the road like a tiny river. Once she finished her business, she stood up and pulled up her pants and underwear, not bothering to wipe.

‘Why bother wiping?’ she thought. ‘We’re all dirty under there anyway; that’s why we have showers.’

She was about to walk away when she turned and saw a local garbage collector standing behind her.

“Just what the hell do you think you were doing?” He asked irately.

“I’m sorry, sir.” Sam said. “I just really had to…”

“What do you think we have toilets for?” He asked. “So that us evolved humans don’t have to deal with indecent savages like yourself.”

“I’m not a savage!” Sam exclaimed. “Besides, isn’t it just as indecent to watch an underage girl take a leak just to bust her? Talk about a pot calling the kettle black, you pervert!”

“Get out of here, you filthy urchin!” He shouted shaking his fist at her. Sam just ran off. “And don’t let me catch you doing this again.”

He then went to collect the trash from the dumpster.

“Kids these days.” He grumbled to himself. “They have no decency and respect for public property.”

Back at Kadic, Sissi was just finishing up her pee. She was just finishing up when she heard a loud knocking.

“Come on, hurry up!” Aelita exclaimed bouncing up and down and holding her crotch. “Some of us still have to go pee here.”

“Just a second.”

Once her stream abated, she wiped her vagina with the toilet paper, readjusted her skirt, pulled up her garments and flushed.

As soon as the door unlocked, Aelita made her way inside the stall, pushing Sissi out of the way and locking the door behind her. Immediately after, Aelita dropped her panties, lifted her jumper dress, showing her vagina (appropriately covered with tufts of natural pink pubic hair just around her slit), and sat on the toilet.

With nothing holding her back, a torrent of her pee came out of her at such a great force and made contact with the water below. Aelita closed her eyes and sighed happily as she was finally able to relieve herself after so much agonizing pain; she even giggled a bit when the force of her peeing caused a tickling sensation in her urethra. More time passed; she was amazed by how much was coming out of her. Even she didn’t know how strong her bladder was and how much she was holding in.

After a full couple of minutes, what started out as a large torrent eventually died down to a small trickle as the tinkling sound grew dimmer. She then pushed out the last spurts of pee until only a few drops fell from her urethra and clung to the pink pubic hairs. She then grabbed the toilet paper, wiped off the wetness on her hairs and in between her labia. She then stood up, pulled up her panties and flushed.

Aelita then emerged from the stall with a relieved look on her face as she went to the sink and washed her hands.

“Wow, Aelita.” Yumi said. “I never thought such a petite girl like yourself could make so much pee.”

“Yeah.” Sissi said. “I’ve never heard anything like it; like someone put a fire hose in the toilet.”

“Um, thanks…” Aelita said blushing.

“No need to be embarrassed about it.” Yumi said. “Everyone pees, it’s only natural.”

“I know.” Aelita said shutting off the sink. “So I take it you’ll be leaving us alone now, Sissi?”

“Huh? Oh, yes.” Sissi said. “A deal’s a deal. You won’t be hearing from me...”

“Good to hear.” Yumi said. “Come on let’s get you back to the dorms and me back home.”

When the other two girls finally left, Sissi just turned around and smiled to herself.

“…Much.”

Chapter 3: Sissi's Revenge

{{:

It was nearing halftime as Kadic’s soccer team was plowing down the field with the ball on their side. They had been dominating throughout the entire game and were ready to take home another victory in what is already a stellar season. Although the game itself was reaching the closing seconds of the half, the people in the bleachers were already looking forward to the outstanding halftime routine by Kadic’s own cheerleading squad. What they weren’t expecting, however, was what would come to be probably the most humiliating experience for one certain cheerleader.

In the girls’ locker room, Sissi was already sitting on the bench getting ready for her chance to dazzle the crowd. It was a hot day, so she thought it would be a good idea to be well hydrated before the big routine. She picked up a bottle of water next to her and took a huge swig. She then looked in the bottle to find that she had completely emptied it.

‘I must’ve been thirstier than I thought.’ Sissi thought to herself. ‘Well, time to dispose of this.’

She then walked over to the nearest trashcan and threw away the empty bottle. She then walked away and went to meet with the rest of the squad. However, before she could take another step, she felt a familiar twinge in her lower abdomen.

“Boy that water went through me fast.” Sissi said bouncing up and down slightly. “I really have to go to the bathroom.”

Sissi walked quickly to the other end of the locker room where the toilets were. Between where she was and the toilets, she noticed the cheerleading squad was all ready and waiting for the signal to go out.

“Hey, Sissi.” One cheerleader said. “Why in such a hurry.”

“Can’t talk. Gotta go pee.” Sissi said quickly as she ran past them with her hand covering her private area.

She then reached the toilets, which consisted of three stalls and a sink. She went to the first stall only to find that another cheerleader occupied it. She tried the next one, only to find that some inconsiderate teen forgot to flush her gross excrement. Immediately disgusted, she tried the last stall only to find that it was out of order.

“Great.” Sissi said to herself while potty dancing in front of the stalls. “What am I supposed to do now? I can’t perform with a full bladder.”

She looked at the sink and briefly considered that, but she realized that the sink was made of fragile porcelain and was fixed only to the wall, so if she sat, odds are it wouldn’t support her weight. She couldn’t just approach it standing from the other end because, being a girl, her plumbing wouldn’t work that way, and this wasn’t the time to learn how.

“Ohhh. What to do?” She said in desperation. “A-ha!”

In a sudden moment of realization, she ran back to the trashcan on the other side of the room and dug through and through until she eventually came across an empty water bottle. Sissi remembered that she had learned how to pee in a bottle when she was a little girl during long car trips. It had been a while, but now it was time for a refresher. She took the bottle and got behind the trashcan so that everything below her waist was hidden, she then spread her legs apart, pulled her panties down to her knees and bent her knees slightly. She then spread her labia with one hand while placing the opening of the bottle to her urethra with the other. She was about to relax until…

“Sissi!” Sissi froze in place and turned to find one of the cheerleaders calling out to her. “What are you doing?”

“Oh nothing.” Sissi said nervously. “I was just looking for some money I had dropped.”

“Well it can wait.” The other cheerleader said. “Coach wants us on the field pronto.”

“Alright, I’m coming.” Sissi said pulling up her panties and disposing of the bottle.

‘Damn.’ She cursed to herself. ‘Now what am I supposed to do?’

After getting outside onto the field with the rest of the team and sitting on a bench in the front row. Sissi could only fidget and cross her legs as the urge to urinate grew at an alarming rate.

‘Oooh, I feel like I’m gonna explode.’ Sissi thought to herself, clenching her teeth and rubbing her crotch. ‘Good thing I only have to do the baton routine; I don’t think I can handle all those twists and flips in my state.’

“Alright everyone!” The announcer said. “Put your hands together for Kadic’s own cheerleading squad!”

The crowd then cheered as the cheerleader came onto the field, led by an increasingly desperate Sissi.

“K-A, D-I-C! The greatest team in history!” She and the other cheerleaders said twirling her baton and waving their pom-poms respectively. “W-O-L, V-E-S! The Greywolves they will pass the rest! Gooo…KADIC!”

The team then got together for a series of flips and stacking as Sissi kept twirling her baton. For someone with a full bladder, she was doing a good job keeping her composure. However, that couldn’t last long as she felt another sharp pain in her bladder. Sissi new her reputation was at stake and couldn’t afford to wet herself in front of a whole crowd; she had to resort to drastic measures.

Sissi ran outside of the field, which cause the cheerleaders, in their confusion, to lose their balance during the pyramid and collapse on one another. The crowd was also confused by this sudden change of events and could only sit and wonder what was going on.

Right next to bleachers, Milly and Tamiya, of the school’s underground newspaper, were looking at the footage they had captured of the first half to find what would be good to share, as well as musing over the players.

“Milly, do you sometimes think that Ulrich looks much dreamier in his soccer shorts than anything else?” Tamiya asked.

“Tamiya, drop it.” Milly snapped. “You know he’s too old for you.”

“Well, someone’s certainly being defensive.” Tamiya quipped.

“It’s not like that.” Milly said blushing. “It’s just…”

She then paused and looked behind the bleachers to find Sissi pacing around with her hands on her crotch.

“Tamiya, come over here.” Milly said. Tamiya came over and saw what had caught Milly’s attention.

“Is that Sissi?” she asked.

“Shh.” Milly said.

“Is she doing what I think she…?”

“Just turn on the camera.” Milly whispered. Tamiya then turned on the camera.

“Wait, you want me to…? No, that’s just indecent.” Tamiya said. “I know you have a grudge against her, but that’s going too far.”

“I don’t care.” Milly smirked. “This is exactly what I’m looking for.”

Sissi, meanwhile, had thought she had found a secluded enough area. After looking both ways, she immediately squatted down on the grass, hiked up her skirt and pulled her panties to the side.

“Quick, zoom in.” Milly whispered. Tamiya did as she was told and zoomed in on

Sissi’s backside and the grass below. They then looked at the display screen and saw, clear as day, a heavy stream emerge from underneath her and splatter the grass below.

“Oh my God.” Milly said. “She’s actually taking a pee in the grass.”

“Yeah, and look at that stream.” Tamiya said. “She must’ve been holding it in for a long time.”

Under the bleachers, Sissi gave a huge sigh in relief as her pee continued to flow out and hit the ground with a loud splatter, all while oblivious to the fact that she was being spied on. After finishing up, she wiped her vagina with a handful of grass and stood back up while readjusting her skirt. She then walked away, content and relieved that not only was she able to expel all the contents of her bladder, she was able to do it with nobody noticing her.

Or so she thought…

“This is awesome!” Milly said looking over the recorded footage. “Just wait until we share this.”

“But won’t we get into trouble?” Tamiya asked.

“Only if we get caught.” Milly said. “Besides, with a super scoop like this, it’ll be totally worth it.”

“If you say so.” Tamiya said as they headed back to the field and began to record the rest of the game.

The next day, everyone was getting ready for the next day of school. In the cafeteria, Yumi had just arrived as her friends, Jeremie, Aelita, Odd and Ulrich, were still eating breakfast.

“Hey guys.” She said greeting them. “What’s new?”

“Nothing much.” Jeremie said. “XANA’s been quiet so far; we haven’t detected any activity over the weekend.”

“Well, Milly and Tamiya did tell us last night that they had a great scoop to share with the rest of the school.” Odd said. “I’m just hoping it’s about Ulrich tripping in the first half.”

“Odd, shut up.” Ulrich said.

Just then, MIlly and Tamiya walked up to them with a stack of newspapers.

“Hello there.” Milly said.

“Oh hey, Milly.” Aelita said. “What brings you here.”

“Well, I figured since you guys aren’t fond of Sissi as much as we are, you should be the first to see our big story.”

“Oh, it’s about Sissi?” Ulrich asked as he and the rest each grabbed a newspaper.

“Well, just read it.” Tamiya said. “It’s on the fifth page; once you read it, you’ll find out why we couldn’t put it on the front.”

“Now this I gotta see.” Odd said smiling eagerly and opening the paper up to the fifth page. “Anything with Sissi has got to be…”

He then paused and looked at the picture, his smile fading.

“Oh…my God.” Yumi said as she saw the picture. There, right in front of her, was a clear image of Sissi from behind, squatting down in the grass behind the bleachers and letting loose a jet of pee.

“Wait, wait.” Ulrich said. “You actually snapped a pic of her taking a leak outdoors?”

“Not just a picture, we have a whole video.” Milly said. “Which we sent to a few privileged people.”

“Which I was not for, by the way.” Tamiya said.

“Oh my God.” Yumi said laughing loudly. “This is going to humiliate her to a new level.”

“As much as I can’t stand Sissi, I have to agree with Tamiya.” Jeremie said. “You can’t just snap a pic of whatever and paste it in the paper, especially if it’s someone doing such a private deed.”

“Jeremie’s right.” Aelita said. “Besides, don’t you know how much trouble you’ll be getting into when the principal get a hold of that paper or video? Not to mention what Sissi will do to you.”

“It’s totally worth it.” Milly said. “Besides, Sissi’s been bullying us for a while now. I think we can take whatever she can dish out.”

“MILLY SOLOVIEFF AND TAMIYA DIOP!” They heard Jim shout as he walked up to them. “You are wanted in the principal’s office, now! I think you know the reason!”

“Uh-oh.” Tamiya said.

In the principal’s office, Mr. Delmas had Milly and Tamiya sit down in front of their desk; next to him was his daughter, Sissi. Who had tears coming out of her eyes as her face was fuming with anger.

“So, you two, would you mind explaining the nature behind this picture?” Mr. Delmas asked angrily as he showed them the picture of Sissi relieving herself.

“Well…”

“Don’t say another word.” Mr. Delmas said. “Now let me ask you something: What made you think it was a good idea to take not only a picture but a video of someone, let alone my own daughter, doing such a private act and sharing it for all to see.”

“We only shared it with a few people.” Tamiya said.

“That’s not the point.” Mr. Delmas said. “Let me refresh your memories on something in case you didn’t get it the first time: Voyeurism is a crime; it’s an invasion of privacy and a form of stalking. Not only did you break the law, but you also violated this school’s policy on the production and distribution of obscene photos and videos.”

“I’m sorry, sir.”

“I’m not the one you should be apologizing to.” Mr. Delmas said. “Sissi, I think these girls would like to say something. Don’t you?”

“Yes sir.” Milly said. She and Tamiya then walked over to Sissi, who was still crying.

“Well?” Mr. Delmas asked.

“I’m sorry we took a picture of you peeing.” Milly said.

“Me too.” Tamiya said.

“Whatever.” Sissi said angrily.

“Now, you two, you are to print a retraction and apology for your story and are to cease publishing your paper until further notice.” Mr. Delmas said. “After that, you two will receive a one-week suspension from classes. And starting after lunch today, you will spend every afternoon in detention in the library. Do I make myself clear?”

“Yes sir.” Milly and Tamiya said ashamed.

“Good.”

Milly and Tamiya then walked out of the office slowly.

“Thanks, Daddy.” Sissi said. “I didn’t think that…”

“As for you, young lady, five hours detention every day for the next week.” Mr. Delmas said.

“What?” Sissi exclaimed. “For what?”

“For your act of indecent exposure, of course.” Mr. Delmas said. “You’re a big girl now; you should know that pee goes in the toilet, not in the grass. Just because you were allowed to do it as a little girl doesn’t mean that the habit should stick forever.”

“Yes, Daddy.” Sissi said dejected.

Hours later, Milly and Tamiya were sitting down at the table eating lunch. They were already discussing what had happened this morning.

“Thanks a lot, Milly.” Tamiya said sarcastically. “I told you it was a bad idea to share those images.”

“But wasn’t it worth it?” Milly asked. “After all, we finally got sweet payback for all the times she was mean to us.”

“I guess, but…”

“Hey, babies.” They heard a familiar voice shout. They turned to see Sissi approach their table.

“Oh, hi Sissi.” Tamiya said. “What brings you here?”

“I thought about what I said and I decided to forgive you.”

“Wait what?” Milly asked.

“I decided that maybe we have gotten off on the wrong foot and that I might owe you some sort of apology.”

“You’re apologizing?” Tamiya said.

“Well, yes.” Sissi said walking up behind Milly. “I feel that after looking back, I can see why you’d want to humiliate me in such a cruel way.”

“Oh really.” Tamiya said dryly.

“So let’s make a pact starting now that I will leave you be from now on and will instead do whatever I can to gain your friendship.” Sissi said extending her hand.

“Sound good?”

“Works for me.” Milly said shaking her hand.

With her other hand, Sissi moved towards Milly’s glass of water while she and Tamiya weren’t paying attention and quickly threw a fine white powder inside the water. She then went over to Tamiya and did the same thing to her: Ask for forgiveness, shake her hand and throw in the fine powder without anyone looking.

“Well, I’m glad for once you’re trying to be nice to us.” Milly said.

“Oh, no worries.” Sissi said. “It’s the least I can do.”

She then walked away, grinning evilly, as Milly and Tamiya finished up their water and headed out.

In the hallway, the subject changed to Sissi and her suspicious behavior in the cafeteria.

“Milly, don’t you find it odd that Sissi was being unusually nice to us?” Tamiya asked.

“Especially after what we did to her.”

“Oh, don’t be so suspicious.” Milly said. “I think even Sissi can see the error of her ways. It just takes her reputation being compromised by the so called ‘babies’.”

“Yeah, but this is Sissi we’re talking about.” Tamiya said. “She’s not gonna take this sitting down.”

“You’re being paranoid.” Milly said walking to the door to the girls’ bathroom. “Now if you excuse me, I need to take care of some business.”

“But we have detention.” Tamiya said.

“Hey, when you gotta go, you gotta go.” Milly said. “And I’m not gonna hold it in until after detention.”

“Now that I think about it, I’m feeling the need to go myself.”

The two girls then went inside the bathroom and walked over to the toilet stalls. They tried to open the stall doors, but they found them to be locked; all three of them.

“They can’t all be occupied, can they?” Tamiya asked. Milly then knocked on the doors.

“Hello.” She said. “Are you almost done in there? My friend and I have to go pee.”

No answer.

“Come on, this isn’t funny.” Tamiya said. “I know someone’s in there, so answer.”

Again, no answer.

“Still think Sissi’s being honest with us?” Tamiya asked.

“Great.” Milly said. “She’s mad at us, and as revenge she’s gonna make us wet ourselves.”

“What are we gonna do?” Tamiya asked.

“We’ll just have to hold it in.” Milly said. “After detention, we’ll try and find another place to pee. She couldn’t have gotten every bathroom door.”

“I hope you’re right.” Tamiya said fidgeting. “Now let’s go before Jim yells at us some more.”

The two then reached the library. For the many hours they were stuck in the one room, they felt their urges grow and more pain in their bladders as they struggled to hold in their pent-up pee. With three of the five hours gone, Milly knew she had to ask to be excused, lest she wet herself and face further humiliation.

“Excuse me.” Milly asked. “Can we go to the bathroom?”

“You know the rules.” Jim said. “No talking and absolutely no leaving for any reason.”

“But we really have to go.” Milly whined, squeezing her legs together.

“You should’ve thought of that before you decided to humiliate one of your fellow students.” Jim said. “Let this be a lesson to you.”

Milly just kept her mouth shut for the remainder of the time.

After detention was over, Milly and Tamiya walked briskly out of the library and down the hall, desperately searching for a place to relieve their aching bladders. Everywhere they went, though, the bathroom doors were always locked and had no way to enter.

“Oh, this is hopeless.” Tamiya said crossing her legs and holding her crotch. “We’ll never find a bathroom in time.”

“Maybe we don’t have to find a bathroom.” Milly said hopping up and down, holding her crotch tightly.

“What are you implying?” Tamiya asked.

“We’ll just have to improvise.” Milly suggested.

“No way.” Tamiya said. “We’ll just get in trouble again.”

“Then we’ll go into the woods where nobody can see us.” Milly said.

“Fine.” Tamiya sighed. “But only because I can’t imagine me wetting myself at my age.”

As quickly as they can without being noticed, the two made their way outside the nearest door outside of school and hobbled over into the deep woods just at the edge of the school. Looking around to see if anyone was around, they noticed a tall, secluded bush, perfect for hiding their business.

“Perfect.” Tamiya said. “We’ll just hide behind the bush, go for a quick tinkle, and then we’ll be free and on our way.”

“Great, let’s go.” Milly said.

The two then hobbled over behind the bush with their hands still on their private areas. Once situated, Milly then pulled her leggings and panties down to her knees while Tamiya unbuttoned her pants and pulled them to her knees along with her panties. They then both squatted down next to each other, relaxed and…

“Milly! Tamiya!” They heard a familiar voice. They then pulled up their garments and turned around to find Sissi. “You weren’t about to go pee on the grass like a uncivilized animal, were you?”

“But there’s no place else to go, and we’re desperate.” Milly said struggling.

“Aww, do the little babies gotta go pee-pee?” Sissi mocked. “Well, I wish I could help, but I can’t abandon my plans now.”

“You mean locking the bathroom doors on us?” Tamiya asked.

“Not only that, but also spiking your water with a very powerful diuretic.” Sissi said.

“Just adding it to water and drinking it will cause a rapid filling in your bladder that can only be stopped by relieving yourselves.”

“But where can we pee?” Milly asked.

“Well if you decide to pee out here, I’ll tell daddy everything.” Sissi said. “However, I’ll let it all go if you just wet yourselves right here and now.”

“Let’s just do what she says, please.” Tamiya said in great pain and squeezing her private area.

“No!” Milly said.

“Well, there is a third option.” Sissi said. “After all, you didn’t think I could get to every bathroom in this whole school, did you?”

“There’s an open bathroom?” Milly asked.

“Yep, but good luck finding it.” Sissi said laughing and walking off.

“Please…” Tamiya said squeezing as hard as she could. “Just let us pee ourselves.”

“We don’t have to humiliate ourselves.” Milly said. “We just have to think of where Sissi couldn’t possibly have been.”

“All I can think of are waterfalls, rivers, rain showers and…”

“Showers! That’s it!” Milly said. “The girls’ showers. Everybody knows that the dorms are off limits during school hours; she couldn’t have possibly gone there. Come on, we still have a chance to relieve ourselves.”

Okay, but let’s hurry.” Tamiya said still in pain.
