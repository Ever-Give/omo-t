I vividly remember at least 2 stories, I wanna say from around 2017ish (?) that originated on tumblr about 2 guys.

One had Jake and Alex at a waterpark or pool where one has to pee really bad going down a slide but the other tells him not to pee in the pool, so he waits and holds it up the long line, down the slide, and rushes off to the bathroom only to have a line there also, where he leaks really bad until running off into the mulch.

The other story has I believe the same characters? but I'm not sure, it was definitely in the same writing style as the first tho. 2 guys in the back of a car have to pee in traffic but are close to a rest stop, finally traffic lets up and they both fantasize about going, but right before they get there they get stopped by a cop and fight over a bottle to pee in.

I've tried looking for the og blogs that I saw them on, but all but one blog were wiped completely, and I think the story was also wiped in the great purge. Wayback machine cant seem to find it either on the one blog that was still up that I remember having it. (it was justholdthatthought)

If someone managed to save these stories before they went down that could share it, you would be a HERO. I coulda swore there were also more stories about these guys but I distinctly remember at least these 2
