“Don’t stay up to late rin!” My mom called from downstairs “fine!” I yelled back as I shut down my game and started getting dressed for bed

I laid down on my bed and switched on the radio for some background noise “the third child this week has fallen into a comatose state for an unknown reason there vitals are stable next the weather” ok not listening to the radio as I switched the radio off and began drifting to sleep

I was standing in a cave with waterfalls on all sides “dreams are a powerful thing you know” said a smooth feminine voice that seemed to come from all sides “WHO ARE YOU WHERE AM I” I demanded frantically “you are dreaming and I am a manifestation of your subconscious in fact you can give me any voice or body you imagine I am the you that you don’t know”

“oh ok well what’s going on here” I asked “these waterfalls are dreams the dreams of all the people of this world you can dive in but I don’t know where you will end up but that is what makes you special”

“special?” I asked “you can enter others dreams from here”

“and your the only one with this power therefore you are the only one who can save them”

“who” I asked “our time her is limited go to the hospital touch each of the comatose children I will do the rest”

“ and one last thing what affects you in this dream world affects the real world if possible”

“i don’t get it” I said “do you need to use the restroom?” my subconscious asked “I don’t need to pee but I could go number two” and with those words a toilet appeared in the center of the room so I sat down and Let loose “our time is over come back tomorrow night” and I snapped awake

I slowly sat up as I realized what my subconscious meant by affects the real world as in I hadn’t had gone in a toilet but luckily I was wearing underwear when I went to sleep unluckily I shit myself yeah in hindsight I should of saw that coming anyways after about thirty minutes of wiping myself up and throwing away those panties I texted my mom and headed for the hospital

It was a sad sight the three people almost my age laying in there beds I touched the first ones forehead.

I rushed home and climbed in bed entering the same cave as before “so how do I help them”I asked “you will delve into there dreams”

“how will that help them how did they even end up like that”I demanded “they are all extremely smart but each one came to the realization of their reality,”

“the first was bookish and threw himself into fiction to escape but his mind drew him into a world of his imagination one he will never leave”

“The second was lovestruck but was rejected her mind created a world of punishment for herself and she entered willingly”

“The final one was abandoned and alone for his life he tried to end his life but failed and garnered everyones attention he felt happy and that he finally had friends but they abandoned him for the next sob story so he built a world around himself locking out the real world and sealing him in a imaginary world of friends and family”

“So how do I help them”I asked

“You must entire there dreams and convince them to leave by there own terms”

“Ok makes sense send me in then” I said as a hole opened in the waterfalls

“There is your path take it”

I dived into the hole my body disappearing into darkness before a new place opened up

I looked down and saw I was in a police uniform and the world around me was a warehouse in the back stood three people dressed as stereotypical gangsters I took a deep breath and whispered to my self “just a dream these aren’t real people” before I stood and drew the pistons at my belt I shot the first one in the head and dived behind cover after a few shots i stood back up and took out the other two

I rushed around the corner to see the environment had completely changed now I was wearing a torn leather jacket and jeans holding a baseball bat and standing in a ruined city with zombies stalking the streets I changed forwards knocking heads off and jumping over corpses one but one had surprised me it grabbed at my shoulders and I screamed uirne spilling into the tattered jeans and panties I was wearing and I lunged away as I landed the pavement crumbled beneath me

I fell downwards with a cord tied around my waist and landed above a well polished floor now I was taking the role of a secret agent sneaking around and head shooting guards with a silenced pistol unfortunately I was still as wet as before but as I made my escape in a supercar every thing changed again

I was riding on a horse wearing armor in some kinda fantasy land thankfully the wool bodysuit worn under the armor was containing my accident, the sky was blue and there was a great castle before me I road in and stood before a king slouching on his thrown “I don’t know you?” The king said “what tale do you hail from” I looked him in the eyes and said “I’m not some storybook character, I’m real and so are you however this place in not”

“I am aware why should I stay in a land with no happy endings no epics about heroes no curtain call just an endless drag of monotony” he scoffed a sadness clearly present in his voice

“There is one story you might be interested in” I stated with a smirk

“What is it about?” He asked sitting up and locking eyes with me

“Its a story of an adventure into untold lands a unknown character with a developing personality a huge world where everything is possible” I told him

“TELL ME THE NAME OF THE BOOK” he demanded

“It doesn’t have one...yet” I said leading him on

“Who’s the author?”he asked being drawn in like a shark to blood

“...you it’s your story, the tale of your life you can brave the world in whatever way you want “ he looked dumbstruck but after a minute of stillness the world began to dissolve and fade to white

I was back in the cave Somewhat relaxed that that was over but also confused over everything as well and damn if I’m not good at motivation speeches!

“You did it” my subconscious said with no discernible changes in there voice

“A side note when in someone else’s dream you have no control of your body leaving most things up to me luckily I can control your breathing and such but I cannot control your bodily functions so enjoy”

“Wait wha-“ but I was pulled out before I could finish

I shot awake and reached down to feel a cold puddle between my thighs
