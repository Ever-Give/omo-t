I did as the title stated but i tried to take some short cuts while writing the program and here are the fruits of my labor

“She did a good point of the game but I wanna is a little too late to go back and get it and I have decided it was going on with her she said and her diaper was messed her diaper and cleaned up and cleaned it out she had to a diaper and cleaned up she had to let go of the bed she was soaked in the bathroom she had a good job and cleaned her room she had to let go of it I had her bladder started her diaper she and she had a diaper diaper and she cleaned her room she had to her diaper she was cut her legs together she had to let go of the bed she was soaked she had a good job and I didn’t want to know she had to her privates she had a good job she was going to go pick her out her clothes and then I got her diaper bag and then she grabbed the door and she looked in and her diaper bag was ready she had a bag of wet wipes she was soaked in her clothes she was bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag“

As you can see i cut it off because it endlessly said bag i do not what made it do this and i don’t want to

I don’t know what happened this is based off about thirty random story's off this site that were fed to a AI that apparently got confused so yeah i didn’t read most of the story’s so i am not sure what made it do this

Yeah i saw that it was written to be funny but this is mostly garbage and way too many syntax errors to be worth while and i have no idea why but all the program will do is print the word bag infinity

Actually i did try inputting some homebrew dnd campaigns i wrote and the results we’re not good i don’t know what happens but now the bot will only write about two or three lines of text then repeat the word bag endlessly anyone actually know why it does that

It is not a good bot and I’m surprised i actually got it to run
