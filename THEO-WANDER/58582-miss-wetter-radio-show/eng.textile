“Oh its such a nice night to sit by the fire”

“I just wish tonight would last forever

“Oh I guess I need to go to the bathroom this coffee runs right through me but I’m so comfortable right now I can wait a few minutes”

“Its been a few minutes and I am really starting to feel desperate but its ok I’ll just sit by the fire a little longer”

“I’m headed to the restroom”

*footsteps*

“Oh no! The lock is jammed I’ll just have to ahh hold it”

“It feels like my bladder is about to explode I’m clenching as hard as possible but I’m so *deep desperate breaths* full I think I’m going to burst”
