“I see the stars” she murmured as the dark of night befell them as they lay on the hard ground. The two women stared off into the darkness as they sleep the remains of a battle crumbling beside them.

*three months beforehand*

The lord sat on her throne her sword and staff hanging from a armor stand.

The room was pristine not a speck of dust as the lord who was a women with flowing brown hair with sharp features and was muscular but somewhat out of shape mostly with her years on the throne to blame that throne she had at the age of 23 the youngest ruler in decades

She sat consumed by worry as she waited to receive a message that could be arriving anytime she was sweating with worry as so she claimed

The message arrived the lord squirmed with...anticipation?

Anyways the lord listened closely as a servant read the letter aloud the lord looked...worried? As she had her eyes squeezed shut and her mouth clenched halfway through the letter a faint wind passed through the room and the lords expression changed from the clenched jaw to a deep sigh with a faint smile on her face she adjusted her seat and finished listening the message confirmed it they were at war

The lord excused herself claiming that she required time to develop a plan for war and she walked to her room called her most personal servant and locked the door shut

The lord who’s name happened to be Melissa extended her arms letting her servant by the name of Anna

Anna begann undoing the laces on the back of Melissa‘s dress letting her take deep breaths freely anna also removed the silk fabric of the garment supporting Melissa’s breasts.

Soon Melissa’s entire top was off and Anna began removing the layered skirts that covered a simple fabric miniskirt held on by a fine leather belt that few would ever see something else even fewer wound see the skirt itself was soaked through.

Anna who unfortunately was having to kneel to remove such garments had her head unfortunately close to the skirt that was hopelessly stained yellow

Melissa shifted and said “hurry up i to...just hurry” as her legs squeezed together

Anna was use to doing this as she finally finished unbuckling the belt

And all that was left were the formerly white panties that were regretfully full with the mess squished almost flat against her rear but anna removed the panties and diligently wiped Melissa’s private’s until they were clean.

All the while Melissa tried her hardest not to let out all urine that was left as she was about to rush to the bathroom a knock echoed off the hardwood door “ queen allies have arrived and are requesting a immediately council” anna without missing a beat took something out of a nearby drawer and stated “please spread your legs my lord I highly recommend you wear this” it was a soft garment with buttons on the sides and three inch thick cloth “why must I” Melissa asked trying to escape to her bathroom

“Well...ummm....comfort...and convenience” anna said not giving Melissa much time to think slipping the undergarments on and swiftly redressing the queen

With that Melissa was rushed out the door to the awaiting lords Melissa attempted to walk regally but it was difficult with the unusual bulk.

She sat at the large square table and joined the normal conversation.

Minutes of this pass and something didn’t seem right to Melissa

Before she had ascended to power Melissa had been a soldier and she knew when something was wrong now was one of those times as mere seconds later smoke rippled off the surface of the table yet her days on the battlefield had be more than four years ago her old habits took over

Melissa rushed to the armor stand and swiftly unhooked the staff from its leather bindings she heard noises from the high smoke she took a deep breath and remembered her training “focus remove distractions”she thought as she got ready to rid herself of the bulging pain in her bladder she took a deep breath as the golden liquid spilled down.

But strangely none ran down her legs and at that moment she knew what the garment was. “a diaper”

“haven’t worn one in a while” she relaxed her body and got ready for any oncoming threats

“Hey Lissa” one of her friends whispered they of course were not supposed be taking they were marching to battle.

Lissa as most called her, was marching to her first battle as a solider she in the light plate armor alongside many others all had thoughts of glory and grander not knowing whats to come “what is it” lissa whispered back “do you have to pee” the friend asked “no” lissa lied “ok” similar small banter was shot back and forth until they saw them...the foe they marched against

Lissa joined the charge holding the flimsy looking blade she had been given and stared hacking and slashing and in a blur she was separated from her unit to a near empty side of the battlefield

A person in a showy light blue fabric top that seemed unfit for combat and a skirt that was barely covering anything with slits on the sides yet with no regard to wind the skirt showed nothing and a out of place halbiert on her back.

The women strolled along with long strands of the blue cloth trailing behind her and turned to see lissa all alone

Lissa held her sword shakily and ran at the women who in one smooth motion took her weapon and stabbed at lissa

Lissa fell back to see her Breastplate has saved her

Lissa sat up and scuttled back seeing the women standing above her “looks like i got you” she said in a peppy voice

Lissa was terrified as she stumbled backwards the poorly made pants of her uniform tearing of on a patch of briers she has gone through ripping the cheap fabric off of her chest

The women approached once more and tilted her head and said in the kind of voice that a parent uses on a small child ” aww did you wet yourself” she said as lissa looked down to see the panties she was wearing as she saw more and more rippled out saturating the gray panties the women licked her lips and said “i may just enjoy your company as she got closer and lissa’s world shifted to black

Melissa stood steadfast preparing for whatever came a she spotted a flash of blue and lunged slamming the blunt silver tip of the staff into the assassin the women who was wearing A showy light blue fabric top that seemed unfit for combat and a skirt that was barely covering anything with slits on the sides yet with no regard to wind the skirt showed nothing and a out of place halbiert on her back.

The women hit the ground with long strands of the blue cloth trailing behind her

“You” she said “did you wet yourself this time as well” she said as she and Melissa started clashing there weapon the women’s halbert and Melissa’s staff they fought nearly as equals

Lissa awoke upright naked with her hands bound somewhat comfortably below her a pit above her the women in blue sat up from a nearby chair of the log cabin they sat in “here drink this” the women demanded and lissa still half awake only started noticing her the current events the women was pouring a green liquid down her throat but lissa didn’t struggle She was too afraid the women bent over and leaned close putting her head against lissa’s stomach “do you feel it”

“rippling throughout your body shaking it to its core”

Lissa felt a sharp pain as the strange liquid shot through her taking anything in her stomach and shooting out into the pit in a pressurized jet after nearly two minutes of this it slowed spitting into several trails spilling down her thighs

The women in blue placed a long plank of wood across the pit and began removing lissa’s bounds lissa in a moment of panic she kicked wildly knocking the women into the pit below

The women screeched and was silenced with a splash lissa pulled the wood plank until it fell of into the pit hitting the women’s head knocking her out lissa fell backwards onto the floor trying to stay her breath

She spent minutes before standing back up and beginning to rummage through the log cabin knowing she couldn’t leave in the nude in the first drawer she found several other skirts similar to the one the women was wearing she tried on a gray one that seemed like anyone could see up yet when she looked in the mirror to see nothing was visible she moved and shook but it always stayed down she couldn’t even lift it up it was completely stiff lissa decided it was to showy

Lissa found normal foodstuffs in the kitchen and nothing of interest in the living room but she found the women’s bedroom

The bedroom had many drawers and dressers along with armor stands wearing everything from full scale maile to a pink tutu lissa began looting

Lissa found a simple cloth top and a knee length skirt with built in fabric panties that comfortably cradled her privates, lissa opened a drawer to see numerous folded cloth panties lissa snagged some strangely enough at the bottom of the drawer there was a false bottom, she lifted it away to see what looked like...diapers twenty of them three different types five pull-ups five with tapes on the sides and ten that didn’t connect in any logical way but as soon as she picked one up to get a better look she watched as it moved on its own and disappeared only for her to feel it slot itself in between her legs she now knew what the skirt was for.

Lissa shamefully took all of the diapers for herself and there was a strange contraption that involved several ropes and a diaper a object that confirmed that this woman ether was or had contact with a magic user, they were uncommon but did exist

Lissa on her way out took a halbert with her and left the cabin

Melissa parried a stab from the women’s halbert and returned with full force hitting the women in the stomach and slamming her into a wall Melissa continued with a savage stream of attacks the silver tip of her staff catching the women’s clothes and tearing them off the women tried to hold it in but her body released a small amount of urine

With astounding speed the women threw a object at Melissa but she knocked to back only for the contraption to spring to life with chains binding to the walls and methodically removing what was left of her skirt and her damp panties and the chains holding her still pulled an absurdly large diaper onto her with metal chains across the bottom and sides finally the contraption snapped a lock on the chained diaper so even if she did escape the diaper would stay on yet the contraption finished dangling from the ceiling, Melissa looked at the panties on the ground to see that the bottom was soaked through

Melissa in a mocking tone said “aww did you wet your self”

“did you piss your panties” the women quietly whispered something “what did you say”Melissa said the women spoke quietly and said “yes” she whispered “are you sure I thought you said “I was so scared i wet my panties” didn’t you”

The women yelled “I WAS SO SCARED I WET MY PANTIES NOW LET ME DOW-” she said before cutting herself off and her hands shooting down to her crotch to futility stop herself but it no avail the diaper slowly turned yellow as small droplets fell to the floor “anna remove her and place her in the dungeon and don’t give her any clothes ether” said as she began dragging the other five unconscious queens to her bedchamber to awaken them

Melissa had awkwardly woken up the rest of the lords

One of which had wet herself queen grenson

One had wet and messed herself queen mespisr

Two admitted had admitted to wearing diaper queens shmits and lokedth

And the last one who had clearly messed herself but denied it as she winced and sat down with a loud squelch but she continued denying it queen cosuply

Grenson borrowed some of Melissa’s panties and a dress

Mespisr had brought her own change

Shmits didn’t need a change since she didn’t wet to badly

Lokedth had a servant change her diaper

Cosuply had denied any help and took the no stops ride home without a change

As soon as they all left Melissa locked her chambers and demanded for anna to undress her “whats the rush” anna asked “I need to use the restroom please hurry”

“Just go thats the point of the diaper” anna said Melissa was annoyed but anna was right as she relaxed as a large bulge formed on her rear visible even with her dress on The feeling took her back to her war days

Anna was undressing Melissa when the question appeared “anna where do you get this diaper on short notice”

“Oh it was one of mine i used them for long trips”

“Oh ok then” and they finished in silence

“There is a war going on” Melissa thought sitting on her throne “here i am surrounded by guards and servants undisturbed by the people struck down on the battlefield”

She had made her decision

She was joining the war

Part two

Lissa wandered through the woods unknowingly walking in hopes of finding someone, it had been nine days since she left the cabin and she had not changed clothes the diapers being so convenient sadly she only had one slip in diaper left. No matter how long she walked none of the sounds of a bustling tavern none of the lights of a homestead just forest. She set up camp for the night laid down and lifted up her skirt let the diapers do there thing while she enjoyed the convenience of magic

Later lissa laid down for rest that night as she did many nights it was cool out but she was warm enough and sleep took her

Melissa listened to her adverses they were to worried but she did not heed them Melissa was on a warpath and there was no stopping her.

She stood above her army on the large stage preparation for the rousing speech to rally the hunters to war. her force the land of sliavea ten thousand strong against the upstart nation of searsler that had a meager one thousand it would be simple hardly a war at all.

It was an ok speech but Melissa was never one for presentation so feeling the unease she drew her wheel lock pistol and pointed it at the sky after five or six pulls of the trigger it fired the shot in some random direction the people were cheering completely sure in there leader unaware of the droplets of urine in her panties

Lissa lay groggy from sleep only to be snapped awake by the sound of sticks breaking the noise getting closer and closer she scurried for her halbert soon she saw a lady in a modest green tunic and a foil at her side the women approached in a friendly manner

“Ho there traveler”she said nicely “would you kindly put down the weapon” she followed up with

Lissa set the halbert down and asked “can you tell me where i am”

“Ok how about we play a game first” she proposed drawing her sword

“A sparring match” the women offered “you win and i tell you anything you want to know and be on my way”she started but before lissa could say anything The women finished with “and if i win...you get to be my slave for six months and do whatever I please”she said with a evil gleam in her eyes

“So what will it be”she said “and you up for a match”

Lissa thought for a moment what could she do with a foil against a halbert that flimsy sword would snap in a second

“I agree to your challenge” lissa stated confidently only seconds later feeling some... inconvenient urges

“Ok now” the women said taking a stance

“Ok i just need to hold it a little while longer Lissa thought to her self as she brandished the halbert the lady snapped into action Lunging strait at lissa, lissa of course blocked with her halbert the women stopped short the tip of her blade pushed against the wooden shaft of the halbert yet despite her failed attack she grinned and said “do you know the smallest splinter in wood can split the entire shaft” lissa was confused for a moment before the women trusted her blade the wooden shaft reduced to splinters lissa jumped sputtering urine then she remembered she was wearing a diaper she took a deep breath and let it go the fabric clinging wetly to her privates. soon the diaper full settled between her legs,she got ready and went on the offensive

Melissa entered the tailors “I need an outfit refitted” she stated “right away” the cleck replied and funneled her into the backrooms she had known this tailor for years. Theo silver was a youth of 24 well dressed and had a head of purple hair that he spent to much money on purple dye keeping it that color he and Melissa had been on and off for about six years she was wearing “do you mind” he asked “never for you” she replied. he skillfully undid the lace and had the outfit off in minutes “you still can be My servant” she offered “no I could never do that it would upset my father we have a very proud bloodline as tailors” he knelt down to remove her skirt “anyways hows yo-“ he cut himself off after removing her underskirt and getting a fill view of the numerous yellow stains on her white panties “care to explain” theo asked politely “Its been a...minor problem recently” she explained

Theo sighed and said “I have something for this” and he left the room and returned with a pile of clothes “first please change out of those” he said handing her a pair of clean panties and he pulled a curtain and let her change she stepped out and stretched a minute “they feel...bulky” she said “they will absorb and small...mishaps and these” he said pulling a extremely thick cloth diaper out of the pile “they will be hard to walk with but for a long ride they are perfect”

“and lastly” he pulled out a thinner pull on diaper “for more active use” her finished fitted her armor “you have some rust on the thigh plates make sure to avoid we-“ he cut himself off again and rushed her out

Lissa lunged her weapon getting shorter and shorter with each attack. The women struck with her blade lissa ducked to the side and elbowed her in the back the womenfell to her knees lissa took a few steps forward her back to the women suddenly...click all of lissa’s muscles tensed as she turned around and saw the women holding a wheel lock pistol that had misfired with the morning dew

Lissa ran at the women who stumbled across the wet grass her tunic riding high she slipped fell on her face giving lissa a clear view of her panties that had warm piss spilling down her thighs as a large bulge slowly formed in the back of her panties

Lissa got ready to leave her camp packed and the women tied to a tree

And they both continued there journeys
