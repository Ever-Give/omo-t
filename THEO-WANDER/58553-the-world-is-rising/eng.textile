Ok you may not believe this but I am telling the truth please you won’t regret it

Her name is Inessa Hirai and her story starts now

She sat in her bedroom slowly turning throughout a magazine occasionally drawing a red circle around something she liked, but after a while she decided that she was done for the day.

She stood up and looked around, the small apartment’s ceiling fan rotating in a lopsided manner but nothing seemed out of the ordinary. She walked along the squeaking floors and opened the bathroom door but as she was about to shut the door something caught her attention, not the rattling of a locked door...but the small jingle of her lost keys her body immediately went into flight or fight and she choose fight

She ducked behind the bathroom door and waited for the telltale squeaking of the floor “one, two ,three” she murmured to herself before slamming the bathroom door open and it crashed into the intruder but that wasn’t it she heard two more following, thinking quickly she lunged across the hall into the small closet. Immediately she reached into a small bag drawing her weapon of choice

It was a knife made out of a durable plastic similar to what a police officer would practice with or for her a perfect weapon for none lethal takedowns.

She could hear them they were both in the hallway now was her chance

She stepped out of the closet brandishing her plastic knife and she shut her eyes then flung them open her vision appearing in black and white she saw her targets two masked women holding semiautomatic rifles but to her they looked like they were moving in slow motion, she marked three points on their body’s then she moved in a perfect smooth path hitting each point she marked hard with her knife

Her name was Inessa, her occupation:secret services that ability she used was not magic it is a evolution of the human brain allowing her to speed up its perception of time making everything look like slow motion then allowing her to mark targets after that she will move perfectly to hit each target but her body acts as if hours passed that leads to side effects such as

Inessa looked at their unconscious body’s then she shut her room door then she realized “god damn it these were new pants” she muttered annoyed at her body she felt the fabric of her panties growing wet then a large dark splotch on her gray pants the annoying part was she didn’t even feel herself pee

Her ability will allow her to move perfectly to hit each target but it allows her body to run on auto pilot that controls her breathing,blinking and bladder control

Inessa tied up the three unconscious body’s and left them on the bed then stripped off her wet pants, Inessa looked in the mirror “what kind of baby I’m I wetting myself at twenty two years old” she said her previous white panties hanging loose on her body. She changed out of the wet panties and put on clean clothes

Inessa watched as one of the women stirred she had been the last too enter and had been the first to wake up

She struggled against her bounds but then saw Inessa’s face and stopped terrified “It-t-ts you, your the pink devil!” she Stammered the the women struggled as hard as she could but again to no avail “listen I’ll tell you everything just don’t kill me” she cried.

Inessa was about to start asking questions but the woman started answering every single one “they were sent to kill you! But I‘m not a killer I’m only part of the team to do seduction I mean look at my outfit” she stuttered and true to her words her outfit was a tight black bodysuit with no legs along with high stockings it wasn’t an outfit to fight in “please I won’t tell anyone I was sent by the organization inferno I don’t know much they just paid us we’re freelancers!”she cried the last bit her eyes forced shut as tight as they would go, her whole body was quivering “please don’t kill me”she whispered as Inessa heard a familiar sound looking over the woman had wet herself “one last question”Inessa said “what did you call me?”

The woman immediately said “the pink devil”

“Why is that”Inessa questioned

“I don’t know” she said carefully

Inessa had all she could take of this “look I’m leaving this place here” Inessa tossed her a skirt “at least put this on”
