Hey everyone. I have no idea when or even if I plan to continue this. I've been busy and recently just havent had much motivation to do much of anything. However, I can't just let down all you lovely people who support this so I may just continue to update when I can.

I do plan to continue this I just feel the need to play through Before the Storm again just to get a sense of character again. So happy to see support for this and I will define try to make more fictional works for you all to enjoy. But for now If any of you have any suggestions or criticism you want me to keep in mind while working on the next part please let me know.
