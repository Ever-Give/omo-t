One day I went to my local golf course for a round of golf,I was not a good player by any means and I only took the game up for the exercise and to get my muscles stronger after my bad fall from a tree,anyways when I got there it was packed,I went to get a tee time and the golf pro told me that because it was so packed all rounds were going to be either threesomes or foursomes..he then said take a seat and I would be called when a time was available and also told who I would be playing with,I then went and sat in the dinning room and ordered a coffee,a cheese burger,and a side of fries as there was speakers in there and I would still be able to hear when I was called up to play..when my order arrived about 15 minutes later..

I was pretty hungry as I had only had a very light breakfast that morning that consisted of some coffee and toast,it took me about 25 minutes to eat it all,and it was pretty good timing as five minutes after I was done I got called to the front desk to find out who my opponents were going to be,to my surprise he told me I would be playing alongside three women he then told me where they were at, I grabbed my golf bag and rented a pull cart and out I went to meet them..

When I got to the spot they were at I smiled very mush on the inside as well as the outside as the three women were beautiful and I was blown away by their sweet smiles when they seen me walk up to them,they one by one introduced themselves..one said hi my name is Wendy then another said hi my name is Brenda,and the third said pleased to meet you my name is Heather,I then after the big smile left my face said hi so pleased to meet you all..my name is Kerry..

As we walked towards the first tee I had a couple of thinks I was thinking about,one was I bet these ladies are good and I hope I do not look like a fool playing them as I had only taken the game up 5 months earlier,the second on my mind was I hope they do not find out that I have diapers and rubber pants on as that fall I had made me incontinent as I had did some nerve damage in that fall and it was the only thing out of all the damage I had done to my body that could not be repaired and because of it I did not get the potty message anymore and that is why I wore the diapers in the first place,but figured if I was careful they would never know I had them on me.

When we got to the tee we drew straws to see who would go first..Brenda won then Wendy..then Heather..then me..it was a par 4 400 yard hole,Brenda's tee went as straight as could be about 274 yards,Wendy then hit hers just as straight and around 260 yards,then heather shot and hers went about 276 and hers was just as straight as the others..then came me and I concentrated on the shot very hard then nailed all of it..also dead straight and 284 yards..as I walked with the ladies to our landing spots..

I could not help but feel a bit excited that at least on the first hole I did just as good as they had..and all three told me just how good a shot it was and that brought a big smile from me.on the second shot Wendy nailed a beauty to the green about 12 feet away from the hole,then Brenda hit and also put it on the green,this time 8 feet from the hole,heather then shot hers to 4 feet from the hole..I then got ready to hit mine again concentrating very hard and nailed another good one..and to my surprise it stopped 3 feet from the hole..

Wendy then putted and it almost went in..but just lipped out at the last second..Brenda then put hers in the middle of the cup for a birdie,as well as a birdie's for both Heather and me..Wendy settled for par again as we walked off the first hole I was again in static how well things had gone on that first hole and hoped more was to follow..as we all walked to the 2nd tee the ladies said they were only going to play nine holes to witch I replied that was all I was going to play as well..and we all got a chuckle out of that one,the 2nd was a par three 272 yard hole and Brenda was first up..

She used a four iron and hit it pretty well but it veered to the left and into the rough leaving her 20 yards from the pin, Heather then hit almost the same shot again into the rough but 8 yards closer,I then hit mine and did not hit this one that well it went into the rough as well but 35 yards away from the pin,then Wendy stepped up and nailed it good one and she landed it on the green 3 feet away from the pin..all of us on our next shots found the green and all were close..Me Brenda,and Heather all made par..Wendy made a birdie..and we walked to the third tee all tied up on the score sheet..but golf is about having fun and we were all doing that..and it was great and we were all just loving it and talking up a storm..

We then reached the very long..par 5 third hole that had a sharp dog leg to the right about 150 yards off of the tee..I was the first one to tee off,and was feeling very good that I had been keeping pace with the three new lady friends I had just met..I then pulled out the driver,concentrated on the shot,then nailed it..and for the first 100 or so yards it went nice and straight down the fairway,then it started to turn to the left..and just kept turning..I was a bit worried now because there was an out of bounds marker over in that direction and I wondered if it was going to miss all of that or cost me a stroke..I could not see where it landed so I started on my trek to go and find it..meanwhile the other three ladies all teed off and with much better results then mine as all were laying nicely on the fairway when they were done..meanwhile I was still tracking down my ball,when I did finally find it ..

I had got very lucky as it was 25 yards away from the out of bounds marker..but still I was a long ways from the fairway..at least 145 yards..I grabbed a 5 iron out of the bag and as I prepared to hit it I heard a small rumble in my tummy..but there was not a lot I could do about it so I just shrugged it off..and went on to hit the ball..well I got all of it and it flew back onto the fairway..landing about 35 yards from the three ladies who were already at their golf balls and ready for their second shots..right after I hit my golf ball I reached back and touched my bottom right away because of the tummy rumble that I heard..and it was not a total surprise to me but both my rubber pants and my diapers were slowly expanding..

I tried to stop filling my pants but was unable to do..so I just sort of stood in the one spot and continued pooping and wetting my diapers..after nearly 30 seconds the expansion stopped..and I reached back and felt my backside again..I had deposited a very firm load in my pants and the bulge was unmistakable as to what I had done if anyone had looked down in that direction,this got me thinking a lot to myself as to how could I continue on playing with my nice women friends,and also hoped they would not find out my secret..

To be continued very soon
