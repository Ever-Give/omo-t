It was a just a normal Friday at work,but also was a long weekend coming up and it was payday as well,I had worked hard all day at my job catching up on and finishing some things that I had been working on for the last week or so,I work at a window and doors plant and had spent over half of the day putting the finishing touches on 7 windows I had built earlier that week..and that lasted till close to noon to finish them all..as I had started work that morning at 7 am..after I was done the windows it was close to lunch time and decided right after I ate I would finish off the five doors as well that I had also built,it was a very nice sunny day out and the temperature was about 70 degrees.

And when the bell rang to let the plant know that it was lunch time, I went in and grabbed my lunch box and went outside to one of the many benches out there to eat my lunch, while siting on the bench a nice lady of about 28 years old asked if she could join me I knew she was 28 because she had told me that about 5 months earlier,I liked her a lot and she liked me as well and she had worked there up to that point about four years..I had been there nearly 5 years and her name was Linda,she had nice long blonde hair and looked just fantastic even in her work clothes and I think the one thing that we had in common besides working at the same place was that my hair was blonde as well,anyways as we started talking and having a pretty good time as well as smiling back and forth at one another,she told me that tomorrow..

(Saturday)..was a very special day for her and when I asked why was it special she informed me that is was her 29th birthday..I then asked her what plans she had but in the back of my mind I was thinking of asking her out to dinner to celebrate it on that Saturday..she told me that she was going to see her parents that lived in the next city about 35 miles away..but also told me she was planning on returning around 2 pm or so that afternoon..well I had just two weeks earlier rented my very first apartment and it was a great place and was fully furnished..I then asked her if she wanted to come maybe over to my place for dinner when she got back,I also told her that I love to cook and would make her whatever she liked..she smiled and agreed,then I told her I would pick her up at 5 pm,and the dinner date was set,she also gave me directions to her place as well as her phone number..

A few minutes later the bell sounded again and that meant it was time to go back to work..we both smiled huge smiles at one another then we both got up and went back indoors and I was feeling very good about my self asking her to come for dinner,I right away went to work on the doors and by 3pm I had finished them all as I only had to sand them a bit and put all of the hardware on them,we got off work at 3 30 pm and the timing was pretty good as at 3 15 the boss came out with all the paychecks and handed them out to the employees I then swept the floor of my work area till the bell rang again signaling it was quitting time,I then went and grabbed my lunch box but on the way I again met Linda and we talked for a few minutes and she said I am sure looking forward to seeing you tomorrow,I smiled to her and said me as well..and with that said she got in her car and drove off..I then got in my truck and also headed off...to be continued on my next visit
