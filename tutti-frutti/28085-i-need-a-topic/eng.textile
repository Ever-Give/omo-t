Hello guys, it's been a while since I've written something omo related. I just have so much work that I somehow can't come out with anything just by myself - without a better reason. So I thought about it - and I think I can write some good texts.

I ask you than - will you be as a group willing to think out some good scenarios to write a story about? I would then take the ideas and I'll try to transform it into a story.

If you want to make yourself an idea about my previous writing, there is a piece of it - https://omorashi.org/topic/18712-possible-new-story-the-ability/

So, let me know, if you would like the idea proposed above...

Oh I'm mainly into female omo. Male omo only when it includes myself :) And I'm certainly not gonna include myself in the stories... so yeah, I prefer F-Omo.

Maybe you'll be surprised, but this is quite a hard question for me. I'm into omo for nearly 15 years. And yet when it comes to this simple question, I am afraid I can't put together a meaningful explanation. But i believe a certain part of my fantasies is contained in the few stories to which I linked in the first post...
