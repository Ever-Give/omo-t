Context: This tale draws on British folklore and herbcraft pertaining to the potent diuretic properties of dandelions and includes some historical features of medieval England. Ealdormen were local, administrative leaders (similar to earls) who also served as liaisons between their people and the king. I'd love to hear feedback from folks with more expertise in the field about this. As for the rest of us history/herbcraft nerds- enjoy!

The Ealdorman’s Family

The year is 1010 CE in the town of Warwick (then Waeringwic) in the kingdom of Mercia. Today is the day that the king is visiting the royal mint in Warwick and an ealdorman named Aethelwulf will be presenting his family.

###

Cora the eldest daughter (22 y/o)

Cora awoke with a jolt of energy and immediately sat upright. She used both hands to pat her naked body and the mattress beneath her. “Yes!”, she exclaimed as loudly as she could in a whispered voice. She didn’t want to startle her sleeping sister, Aelfwynn, as she celebrated yet another dry night.

“That makes one full cycle of the moon”, Cora thought to herself as she calmly laid back down and folded her hands over her abdomen. “Maybe my wish is coming true.”

Although Cora had prayed to God for a dry bed every night, she had also tried an old, pagan remedy that many Mercian women still swore by. A month prior, on May Day, Cora plucked a brilliant yellow dandelion that grew unusually tall from her grandmother’s grave. As she took in the aroma of the flower, she recited the words that her mother taught her:

“As flowers bloom, and fledglings fly,

Please help keep my mattress dry”

Since the spell was intended to help mothers keep their children dry, Cora had changed the last line a little bit. After she said the spell, she buried the flower next to her grandmother’s headstone and returned to the May Day festivities.

Today would also be a day of feasting and celebration. Although she still had about an hour before the rest of the family would ready themselves to greet the king’s procession, Cora leapt from her bed and put on her underdress. She quickly put on her bliaut and tied the belt around her waist. In her excitement, she cinched the belt a little harder than she had intended and the pressure caused her full bladder to leak a gentle stream of urine onto the floor. For the first time that day she noticed how full her bladder actually was.

She felt a tightening in her chest as leaked and quickly made for her chamber pot. She continued leaking as she hiked up her bliaut and underdress and squatted over the large metal bowl. As she relaxed her pelvic floor, the forceful stream made a loud hollow sound as it made contact with the metal followed by the sound of liquid pooling and churning in the bowl below. Cora tried to steady the force of her stream so it wasn’t so loud, but her control was limited once she started. She looked over at Aelfwynn sleeping and saw her stir in the bed. After about 20 seconds Cora finished peeing and stood up. She used a rag by her bed to wipe away the narrow trail of urine that had escaped her earlier, and carried the chamber pot out of the room.

Bronwynn, the eldest woman servant of the house, saw Cora in the corner walking with the chamber pot out of her eye as she prepared breakfast.

“Need a hand with that, my lady?” Bronwynn asked.

“No- thank you. I can handle it,” Cora replied

“Do I sense another dry night, my lady? I always get concerned when I don’t see chamber pots leaving first thing in the morning. Makes me think you’re either not drinking enough or drinking too much before bed,” Bronwynn said, cheekily.

Taken aback by the candor but still celebrating her success, Cora replied, “There’s at least one less mattress for you to clean today.”

Aelfwynn the middle daughter (20 y/o)

“Stop it, Ceolwulf,”Aelfwynn called to her younger brother who threw flower after flower at her chanting:

“Dandelion, dandelion, hex my sis,

Make sure her bed is soaked with piss”

“You’re such a nuisance. You know that doesn’t work. You’re just killing flowers now,” Aelfwynn said as they walked along the road to Warwick.

“Of course it works!” replied Ceolwulf. “Remember when you picked up those dandelions and pressed them into my back? I wet the bed every night for weeks!”

Aelfwynn laughed, “I don’t think the flowers had anything to do with that. You always piss the bed, at least more than any of us.”

“Pissed the bed. I’ve been dry for- well- at least three months,” Ceolwulf retorted.

“Very impressive,” Aelfwynn said sarcastically, though she had only been dry for about a year herself. All of the ealdorman’s children wet the bed into adulthood, just as the ealdorman and his wife, Gyda, had.

Whether it was all the talk of wetting the bed or a side-effect of the dandelion torture, Aelfwynn’s bladder started clamoring for her attention. She spied a large elderberry bush just off the left-hand side of the road. Aelfwynn looked ahead and behind her to see that no one else was coming.

“Ceolwulf, make yourself useful and stand in front of that bush. I need to pee.”

“You seriously can’t make it back to town? I didn’t expect those flowers to work so quickly,” Ceolwulf said with a chuckle.

“It’s not the flowers, idiot. I drank some of mother’s tea this morning,” Aelfwynn replied.

“Oh, the dandelion tea? Seriously Aelfwynn you know that goes right through you,” Ceolwulf taunted.

“Just shut up and make sure no one comes back here,” Aelfwynn said as she started hiking up her dress.

She barely had time to squat before a thick, clear torrent of piss shot out of her onto the ground with a loud hiss and a splash. The urine quickly collected in a small puddle beneath her. The release was incredible; Aelfwynn felt tingles ripple through her body from her fingertips to her toes. She felt liquid splashing back onto her bare feet and legs, so she started to slowly raise herself up. However, instead of feeling less splashback, she felt more. In fact, she could feel immense warmth and wetness spreading along the underside of her thighs and creeping slowly up her back.

With a start, Aelfwynn sat up in bed and made the dreadful realization that her dream had caused her to completely wet her bed. She felt soaked and warm from knees to butt and the urine on her back now cooled as she sat upright on her sodden mattress. With her right hand she held her blankets in front of her bare chest as she inspected the damage with her left. She pressed against the canvas layer and heard the squish of wet wool underneath her. Of all days for this to happen, this was the worst she could imagine. Thankfully Cora had already gotten up.

Aelfwynn threw her blankets off the bed and squeezed what she could of the urine from the ends of her hair. She rose from her bed, naked and damp, and used a rag to wipe herself down. She then retrieved a small bundle of dried lavender, divided the bundle into two parts and tied it around each leg. She hoped that the extra lavender, in addition to some lavender powder under her arms, would mask the smell of urine. Between the smell of piss and flowers, she chose the latter. Before she could throw on her underdress, Cora came back into the room with the empty chamber pot.

Cora averted her eyes as she entered the room, “Oh I’m sorry Aelfwynn I thought you were still asleep.”

“No no it’s OK. I was just- uh- freshening up”, Aelfwynn said putting on her underdress.

As Cora walked to the door to leave the room, she saw Aelfwynn’s sodden mattress, which immediately brought the smell of urine to her senses. But there was another smell as well- something floral.

“I’ll have Bronwynn send her boys in to take the mattress outside,” Cora said with a caring smile. “Can I get you a washcloth?”

“Yes, thank you," Aelfwynn replied.

“The lavender smells nice,” Cora said sincerely.

Aelfwynn smiled as Cora left the room.

Ceolwulf, the youngest and only son (18 y/o)

“Get ye gone, boys! Morning’s only a few hours away,” the tavern owner said, shooing the two young patrons out into the alley.

Brundyr protested. “Ah c’mon, Hildy. Just one more round. Ceolwulf’s gotta be nice and hungover for his date with the king tomorrow.”

“You lads’ll be lucky you make it home with dry trousers. Now piss off," Hildy said shutting the tavern door.

“We love you too, Hildy”, Ceolwulf slurred as he stepped into the alley.

Brundyr immediately pulled his waistband down to piss on the side of the house across from the entrance of the tavern. Ceolwulf stumbled beside him to do the same.

As his stream poured onto the house, Brundyr began to rant:

“I dare you, Ceolwulf, I dare you to stare the king RIGHT in his eyes tomorrow, yeah, and *hic* and tell him that there isn’t a *hic* there isn’t a king in Mercia, in *hic* Wessex, Wales, or *hic* Northumbria that can kill a Dane *hic* better than a WARWICK man. You tell him *hic*- Ceolwulf- you *hic* are you OK?

Ceolwulf leaned pressing his left hand against the house, while his right hand clutched his crotch.

Brundyr finished peeing, sheathed his ‘sword’, and turned to look at his friend. “Ceolwulf, what are you *hic* what are you doing, Ceolwulf?”

Ceolwulf turned and lurched out of the shadow of the house into the moonlit alley. Brundyr walked around Ceolwulf so he could see his front. Still clutching his groin, Ceolwulf stood with his knees turned inward and two thick, obvious wet streaks down each leg of his pants. Brundyr guffawed and cackled as he realized what had happened. “Oh no, Wulfy, what’d you do?”

“Brundyr, I need to *hic* go home. I got a lotta do. I- uh- got a lotta do before I *hic* go see the king.”

Brundyr continued laughing and put his arm around Ceolwulf. “We should go show Hildy. She’d have a laugh AND a piss I think”.

Ceolwulf shook Brundyr’s arm off of him and in his stupor pleaded, “Please don’t *hic* tell anyone, Brundyr. Please don’t tell anyone. This is *hic* shameful. Please don’t tell, Brundyr, please *hic*”

“You have my word, Wulfy. I won’t tell anyone- at least until the king leaves town.”

Ceolwulf shoved Brundyr into the side of the tavern. “I’m only joking, lordy”, Brundyr said laughing. “What did you think would happen after a whole bottle of dandelion wine?”

That was the last thing Ceolwulf remembers before he slowly opened his eyes. The early morning sunlight shone through the crack between the two shutters in his room. As he laid on his side, he could hear someone stirring in the kitchen, likely getting breakfast ready. He closed his eyes again and put his hands between his legs to go back to sleep in a fetal position. As soon as his hands touched his naked body he felt how wet he was. He rolled over onto his back and felt the wet canvas and wool give under him. Now his back and his left side were wet and the smell of piss was strong in his room.

Of all his siblings, Ceolwulf struggled the most with his bladder. He was not only prone to bedwetting, but also daytime accidents. He would wet himself at least once a month in school and every fight he found himself in- even those he had started himself- resulted in wet pants. His sisters sympathized with him and were especially understanding of his bedwetting accidents. They couldn’t help but tease him though, going so far as to ‘knight’ him Sir Ceolwulf the Wet.

He gave himself a quick wipedown with a rag next to his bed and picked his pants up off of the floor. Forgetting what had happened the night before, he felt a shock as he put his right foot into the cold, damp leg of his pants. He dropped his pants and stepped back- now all too aware of his pounding headache and dry throat. He crawled back into bed and laid on the dry side of his mattress, clutching his head, unsure of his next move.

Ceolwulf’s three-month dry spell was broken. As he laid next to his large wet spot, he suddenly recalled a refrain from one of his mother’s favorite folk tales:

“Lady Boudica, fierce and strong

Took many Roman heads.

When she gave them ‘gifts’ of dandelion wine,

The lot of them wet their beds”*

###

The Ealdorman and his wife (50 and 38 y/o respectively)

Aethelwulf awoke next to his wife Glyda who was still sleeping soundly beside him. At 50 years old, Aethelwulf awaited one of the highest honors of his life. He would tell the king how he and the other ealdormen kept the mint safe and secure. Aethelwulf was instrumental in managing Warwick’s prosperity amid the ever looming threat of raids by the Danes and administered justice in line with his people’s mores and Mercian law.

At present however, he was not focused on business but rather his family.

Aethelwulf came from a long line of ealdormen, starting with his great-grandfather who helped found Warwickshire and later became an ealdorman of Warwick town. Although he was proud of his family line, each one of his ealdorman ancestors were chronic bedwetters. He had vivid memories of his grandmother and mother collecting May Day dandelions to help keep their children dry at night throughout the year. He now saw his wife, Glyda, doing the same for his children year after year.

Aethelwulf felt as if his family’s bladder troubles would affect his children’s future opportunities. Granted, Cora seemed to be heading down a monastic path. She never expressed any enthusiasm for living among men and had an innate talent with the written word and illustration. When Aethelwulf had tried arranging a marriage between Aelfwynn and the son of an ealdorman of Worcester, Edmund, the young man had seemed very interested at first. No doubt- Aelfwynn is quick-witted, a talented seamstress and not to mention quite comely. Sadly, gossip reached Edmund’s ears alerting him that his flaxen-haired beauty was a lifelong bedwetter. And as for ‘Ceolwulf the Wet’, well, he still had a lot of growing up to do in many respects. He wondered if sheltering them from the world did them any good either.

Aethelwulf snapped back to the present moment and felt the mattress beneath him. Dry, as he expected. He slept nude (like most people of his day) except for a diaper made of linen and wool that his daughter Aelfwynn had made. She made one for him and one for his wife Glyda, using a pattern that Glyda herself had designed. Their children wore them throughout childhood as well, but had stopped once they reached adulthood. Though there were many nights that their mattresses (and the servants who cleaned them) would have benefited greatly from them.

Aethelwulf reached over and felt his wife’s side of the bed. Her diaper had leaked a bit, but nothing that required an intensive cleaning of the mattress. Glyda stirred on her side and turned on her back. She blinked open her eyes and turned her head to look at her husband.

“Good morning, my dear. How did you sleep?” she asked.

“The sea did not breach the hull of the ship, so I’d say I fared well,” Aethelwulf replied. “It seems you had a bit too much of that piss-a-bed tea.”

“I had nary a drop thank you very much, but I did fall foul of the dandelion yesterday.”

“Oh?” inquired Aethelwulf.

“I was picking flowers along the river bank and lost track of time. Suddenly I heard the Vespers bell and realized how late it was.”

“Hmmm” Aethelwulf sounded puzzled.

“I realized then that I had picked a few dandelion flowers without thinking,” Glyda said.

“Ah, what is it that the pagans say about picking dandelions at night?”

“‘Pick a dandy flower after four, you’ll pee and pee forevermore’. And you know how my sleeping bladder gets,” Glyda concluded.

Indeed, it was said that picking dandelions after 4 PM would make you pee incessantly throughout the night. While most people would begrudgingly get up to go, Glyda’s bladder would simply not permit that. Glyda, like Aethelwulf, came from a long line of bedwetters. She shared many of her husband’s concerns for their children, but was confident that faith in God and the herbcraft of her ancestors would yield positive futures for their children.

Once Glyda and Aethelwulf cleaned themselves up with wash cloths, Glyda went to check on their children. She was surprised to find Cora already dressed and ready. Her daughter looked beautiful in her dress and leather-tied shoes. Aelfwynn was still eating breakfast but seemed in good spirits. Glyda had helped her put the finishing touches on her bliaut the night before and was confident both her daughters would make a lasting impression.

Ceolwulf on the other hand was a mess.

“You drank a WHOLE bottle of dandelion wine. Don’t you remember the story of Boudica and the Roman legion?” Glyda asked her son, still lying in his bed.

“Yes, but I-”, Ceolwulf began, but Glyda cut him off and continued.

“This is a powerful flower, my son. It’s meant to flush out toxins and keep you well. If you abuse it there are consequences.”

Ceolwulf sat silently and averted his eyes from his mother.

Glyda went on, “This is a big day for your father and for our family. We’re going to celebrate and make merry, but right now we need to get you a pair of your father’s trousers. Last I checked yours have all been pissed.”

“They’ll be pretty loose but I can belt them along with my tunic.” Ceolwulf said sullenly.

“Please do. I take no pleasure in shaming any of my children, but I will ask that you clean your mattress yourself. At least get it out in the sun so it can dry while we’re out,” Glyda finished. Glyda turned and shut the door to allow some privacy as Ceolwulf moved his mattress off the simple wooden bed frame.

As he was moving the mattress he felt something soft hit the back of his head. Turning around he saw Aelfwynn peeking through his window. She quickly ducked her head as both sisters giggled and ran around to the other side of the house. He grunted and sighed and looked down at the floor to see what his sister had thrown. It was a new homemade, linen and wool diaper that she had planned on giving him later. She had not only stitched the letter 'C' in the front, but had also stitched a few dandelions on it as well.

Just before they were to leave for the mint, Glyda picked a dandelion that had gone to seed in the front yard. Before blowing the seeds to the wind, Glyda made a silent wish:

“May our days be merry,

May our nights be kind,

May our accidents remain,

Out of sight and mind.”

*I made up the story of Boudica and the Roman legion, but thought it was a fun bit of fiction

Thank you! I definitely should've edited this a bit more, but I am thinking about a sequel (i.e embarrassment at the mint). Could be fun to get some input from readers as well as far as who wets and how!

A trip followed by a party little opportunity given for relief as they're noble and must follow etiquette, floating their teeth with piss and getting back home...maybe even daring some bet or flirting... Mainly the boy must prove himself a gentleman...

Well that's me daydreaming 😉

Love dystopia

I love the constraints of etiquette and there will definitely be some of that in the sequel! I can't imagine anyone will be able to hold long enough to make it home though. I love the idea of bets and flirting too!

Wow, wow, wow!

I love historical stories. I'm commenting before I have even read the whole thing because I cannot wait to shower you in praise. You've clearly done some research on the time period, nothing feels out of place or too modern.

Great job themerger!

Thank you so much! I hope you enjoy the rest of it 😃
