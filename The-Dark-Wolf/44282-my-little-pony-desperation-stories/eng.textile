My Little Pony Desperation Stories

Here's a series of stories I was requested to write on fimfiction, and I was asked to put them here too. A My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fanfiction centering on the desperation aspect of omo rather than wetting, even though the latter is more my thing, the requestor prefers the former in this style. I'll start with the first one and post the next ones in the replies once enough time has gone by to not merge them.

Rarity's Desperation

At Carousel Boutique, Rarity got out of bed. There was nothing much to do today, so Rarity just sat at her breakfast table and drank a lot of tea, more than she'd usually drink in one day.

Rarity had just finished her 20th or so cup of tea when she heard a knock at the door, and answered it. Twilight Sparkle stood there, with Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, and Fluttershy.

"Guess what Rarity?" said Twilight. "Princess Celestia has called us all to Canterlot to set up a big event where Princess Cadence and Shining Armor are coming over!"

So, at 8:00 AM, they took the train to Canterlot. As the train left, Rarity noticed that she had to pee, as a result of all the tea she had drank. She hadn't known she would go on a trip to Canterlot right away, or else she wouldn't have drank so much.

Rarity could use the bathroom on the train, but she didn't like using public bathrooms. She didn't know how many ponies used it, or if it was cleaned properly. It didn't feel nearly as clean as her own bathroom, or that of the house of one of her friends. She'd prefer to hold it until she got back, although she didn't know how long this would take. She didn't want her friends to notice her desperation, so she'd hide it as best she could.

Eventually they arrived at Canterlot, and ran to Canterlot Castle. Rarity ran nearly as fast as Rainbow Dash and Applejack, wanting to get this over with so she could get back to her bathroom. She was very uncomfortable at this point, but continued to hide it.

As Celestia told them what they needed to do to set her castle up for Cadence and Shining Armor's arrival, Rarity hardly focused on anything until her name was mentioned, trying to hold it in while hiding how desperate she was from the others.

Rarity forced herself to listen more intently as soon as she heard Celestia say her name.

"Rarity, Pinkie Pie, you will help decorate the main room for when they arrive. I know Rarity can make it spectacular, and Pinkie Pie knows how to set up a party."

"I won't let you down," said Rarity, trying to sound casual, though not succeeding very well. Pinkie Pie was a lot more enthusiastic.

So, Rarity started decorating the walls in her favorite designs. This was usually fun for her, but not so fun when she really needed to pee. As a result she didn't set up the banners and decorations as spectacularly as she would but it was still an adequate job.

Around noon, Twilight said "All right girls, you've all done a great job, and now it's time for lunch."

They went to a restaurant, where they each ordered the food they wanted. They were sitting very close to the restaurant's bathroom, but Rarity still thought it would be too filthy for her.

Rarity knew the preparations for Cadence and Shining Armor's arrival would take longer than she had anticipated, and this made her more uncomfortable. She began fidgeting slightly, crossing her legs under the table and hoping the others wouldn't see it.

After a few minutes waiting for their food to arrive, however, her friends couldn't help but notice her movements, and the look on her face. Applejack, who was sitting closest to Rarity, looked more closely at her and saw her legs were crossed.

"Rarity, if you gotta go to the bathroom, there's one right there," said Applejack.

Rarity blushed now that they knew she needed to go. "No, I can't."

"You should," said Twilight. "It wouldn't be good to hold it the entire time we're working, and there's still a lot to do. Now is the perfect time."

"I'm fine," said Rarity. "And I don't like using public bathrooms anyway."

"If you say so," said Twilight, though she didn't look very comfortable at how much Rarity was going to suffer in the following few hours.

At about 1:00, after they had finished their meal, they got back to work. As Rarity continued to decorate the room, her desperation increased. Hours went by, and Rarity had to pee really badly. She had never been so desperate in her life. She was sweating profusely and her desperation showed in her face, but she tried to not make any overt movements to show how badly she needed to pee, as there were other ponies around. Still, she couldn't help but fidget quite a bit, and occasionally put a hoof over her crotch or cross her legs.

"You know, there's a bathroom right there," said Twilight as she walked by Rarity and noticed how desperate she was despite her efforts. "Princess Cadence and Shining Armor don't come until tomorrow. We have all day."

"I'd listen to Twi," said Applejack. "Y'all look like ya can't hold it much longer."

"I'd really hate for you to, um, not be able to hold it," said Fluttershy quietly.

"I told you I'm fine," said Rarity, which was an outright lie, as she wasn't sure how much longer she could hold it for. "Public bathrooms are too filthy."

"Well, if you'd rather risk wettin' yourself than use a public bathroom, go ahead," said Applejack, who at this point thought Rarity was being very stubborn.

Rarity blushed and bit her lower lip as she continued setting jewels on the banners she hung up.

More hours went by, and Rarity became more and more desperate. Pinkie Pie noticed and worked twice as hard so that Rarity wouldn't have to do as much.

By sunset, their work was done. The castle was ready for Cadence and Shining Armor's arrival. At this point, Rarity felt like she was about to burst, but felt a little better knowing she was going to be home soon.

They got on the train back to Ponyville. Rarity wasn't even trying to hide her desperation anymore, squirming in her seat with a pained look on her face. She could feel the pee sloshing inside her and knew she wouldn't last much longer.

"Hey Rarity," said Rainbow Dash with a mischievous smirk on her face. "You think we'll go by any waterfalls on the trip? Remember that waterfall we camped by once?"

Rarity started to feel even more desperate, squirming harder and tearing up.

"Or that fountain I went swimming around in? What about all those rivers, and rain, and..."

"Rainbow Dash, that's not funny!" said Twilight. "Would you like it if you were the one desperate?"

"Not really," said Rainbow Dash. She still did think it was funny, but knew she'd hate to pee herself in Rarity's position, even if she, like Rarity, wasn't wearing anything.

"Um... maybe you should use the bathroom on the train," said Fluttershy quietly. "That's what I'd do..."

Rarity just shook her head.

After what felt like hours to Rarity, they finally arrived at Ponyville. Rarity immediately ran to Carousel Boutique at a speed that would rival Rainbow Dash at her fastest run. There wasn't a second to spare, she could burst at any moment.

Rarity ran into her home, grabbed the bathroom door with her hoof, and pulled. To her dismay, it was locked. Sweetie Belle was inside. Rarity couldn't believe it. She was this close to finally finding relief and she had to wait for Sweetie Belle.

"Sweetie Belle! Hurry up in there!" Rarity hoped she didn't sound too mean, but she really couldn't hold it much longer. She knew she was seconds away from reaching her limit, and was soaked with sweat. This wouldn't be a problem, but if she peed here right outside the door...

At long last she heard the toilet flush, and Sweetie Belle casually walked outside. Rarity ran into the bathroom, closed the door, sat on the toilet, and began peeing.

She sighed in immense relief as she peed for just under a minute, splashing into the toilet. It felt so wonderful to finally let go after holding it for so long. Several times she thought she wasn't going to make it.

Her dislike for public bathrooms had nearly caused her a lot of humiliation, but she would never get over how filthy she thought they were. She'd just have to remember to drink less tea so early in the morning.

@Melificentfan

Thanks.

Part 2 coming now! I think this one's longer.

Twilight's Desperation

Princess Twilight Sparkle was usually busy all day long. Sometimes she'd schedule too much for a single day and freak out when she couldn't get through all of it in time, causing a lot of trouble.

Discord watched this happen yet again one day.

"I think I should teach her a lesson about giving herself time for what she needs to do," said Discord with a mischievous smirk...

...

On a night before a very busy day, Twilight was just finished planning the events when she heard a knock at the door, and opened it.

"Surprise!" said Discord, as he caused several streamers to go flying around the room.

"Discord?" said Twilight. "What are you doing here?"

"Oh, just thought I'd pay a visit to my favorite princess! Well, second favorite, after Celestia."

"Oh. Well, that's very thoughtful of you. I just finished planning for a very busy day tomorrow."

"Is that so?" said Discord, and he began singing a random song, all the while manipulating the area around them in his usual ways.

"That was very fun," said Twilight once Discord's song was over, "but I think I'd better go to bed now."

"Don't you wanna have teatime with me?" said Discord. "Me and Fluttershy do it all the time!"

"Well... I suppose," said Twilight.

Discord deliberately dragged teatime on for about an hour, by bringing out more tea and some sandwiches.

"I should really be getting to bed now," said Twilight.

"But we didn't get to play Pin the Tail on the Pony!" said Discord, taking Twilight's tail off.

"Wait, what?" As soon as Twilight realized her tail was missing, she began chasing after Discord.

"Oh, here you go." Discord zapped Twilight's tail back on her, and then took her wings and put them on his back. "I'm Princess Discord now!"

"Discord!" Twilight chased him again, and he gave her wings back. "Now, can I PLEASE go to bed?"

"One more thing!" Discord sucked Twilight into a Daring Do book, entering it with her, so that they experienced one of Daring Do's adventures, though if they touched anything other than ground it would go right through them, as they were unable to alter anything.

Once they were out, Twilight said "Can we do the next one?"

"Your wish is my command!"

After the original trilogy of books, Twilight said "This has been REALLY fun, but I have a busy day tomorrow so I should get some sleep."

"All right," said Discord, looking a little disappointed.

Twilight got into bed and looked at the clock. It was 2:00 AM. She tried hard to get some sleep, but was kept awake by loud sounds coming from the throne room. Sounds of crashing, and explosions, and what appeared to be a marching band. Eventually she couldn't take it any longer and stormed into the throne room.

"Discord, quit it!"

"I was just having a little fun."

"Well do it back at... wherever you live! I'm trying to sleep!"

"All right," said Discord, figuring now was late enough, and he didn't want to get her too angry. So, he disappeared in a flash of light.

Twilight got back into bed and got to sleep at 3:00 AM.

...

Twilight woke up to the sound of her alarm, and turned it off. With a long yawn, she got out of bed, very tired. She wanted to go back to sleep, but remembered today was a very busy day. So, reluctantly, she got out of bed and drank about 20 cups of coffee, at the end of which she was wide awake.

When the time came, Twilight and Spike boarded the train to Canterlot. In the middle of the train ride, Twilight realized she needed to pee because of all the coffee she drank. She ran to the train bathroom as fast as she could, but to her dismay she found it out of order.

Discord watched disguised as a bird flying beside the train, chuckling to himself, for it was he that put the "Out of Order" sign up.

Twilight reached Canterlot. First was a meeting with Celestia and Luna. Twilight was sure they would forgive her if she was a little late. She ran toward an outhouse, but it also had an "Out of Order" sign on it. So, she flew to Celestia's castle and entered the nearest bathroom to the door, but all the stalls were full. Twilight groaned and walked out the door.

As soon as Twilight was out, the "ponies" inside disappeared, and the doors swung open, for it was another of Discord's tricks.

Twilight raced to the room where her meeting with Celestia and Luna was, deciding to get this out of the way and then find another bathroom before the next thing she had to do.

They talked about upcoming events, such as a wedding in Canterlot, a sporting event, and something about dragons and changelings, as well as the arrival of delegates from Saddle Arabia. As the conversation went on, Twilight's attention shifted more to her bladder, which was starting to feel more pressure every minute.

Twilight tried hard not to move, for she wanted to hide her desperation. Spike had seen her enter the other bathroom but for all he knew she had been able to use the bathroom, not noticing that she had gotten out too fast for that.

Oh, I need to pee so bad, thought Twilight.

After about an hour, their conversation was over. Next Twilight had to go to a trading event, which would last an hour before Luna took her place. So she immediately ran to the nearest bathroom.

"Didn't you just go?" said Spike.

"Um... I need to check if I combed my hair," said Twilight.

She found a bathroom and entered it. She could almost feel the relief right now.

Until she saw that all the stalls had "Out of Order" signs on them.

"AAAAAGH!"

Twilight ran out and rejoined Spike. "Yep, my mane's perfectly combed. Let's... get to the Traders' Exchange."

They boarded the train again. Twilight glanced in the direction of the bathroom door. The "Out of Order" sign was still up.

Actually, it had been re-placed by Discord.

Twilight sat still for the entire train ride, with great difficulty, as she could feel the pressure grow heavier each minute.

They reached Rainbow Falls, and while Spike traded something for a comic, Twilight stood at the podium, there to settle whenever a pony thought a trade was unfair.

As usual, no ponies came complaining to her, because they were usually satisfied with the trade. So, Twilight was sure she could allow herself a bathroom break now, for she really needed to go.

She ran toward an outhouse, but it had an "Out of Order" sign on it. There were a few outhouses in the area, so Twilight ran to each of them, but each had the sign on it. Twilight was becoming more nervous. This was getting serious. Why was every bathroom she tried unavailable?

Discord watched Twilight, greatly enjoying the entertainment. He made all the "Out of Order" signs disappear as soon as they were out of Twilight's sight. It was all part of his plan to "teach Twilight to take care of herself", which was only his excuse because he thought it was really fun to watch Twilight hold it desperately.

Twilight stood at her position for 45 more minutes, sweating a little and trying hard not to cross her legs. She had reached a level of desperation she never knew existed, and couldn't believe she had held it for this long.

Hoping the outhouses were back in order, Twilight ran to check them again, and Discord quickly re-posted the "Out of Order" signs. A pony was inside one of them at the time, and left the outhouse mere seconds after Twilight ran.

At long last, Princess Luna arrived, and took over while Twilight boarded the train to ride it back to Ponyville, for her next event was lunch with her friends.

Twilight crossed her legs on the train ride, noticing the bathroom was still "Out of order". Spike noticed, but dismissed it at first.

They reached Ponyville, and met with Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Fluttershy, and Pinkie Pie at a restaurant.

"How did the morning go?" said Fluttershy, for it was about noon now.

"It was... really great!" said Twilight, trying to keep the desperation out of her voice. "I should probably wash my hooves before eating though."

She ran into the restaurant's bathroom. All the stalls were taken except one. Feeling relieved already, Twilight ran into the stall, only to find it clogged with an entire roll of toilet paper. Twilight knew she wouldn't be able to flush without overflowing the toilet. She considered using the toilet anyway without flushing, but then her pee would be there for whoever was fixing the toilet to see.

Feeling extremely uncomfortable now that relief had been snatched away from right in front of her, Twilight left the bathroom. Discord appeared and snapped his fingers, causing the toilet paper in the toilet, as well as the illusion of other ponies in the stalls, to disappear.

Twilight sat down at the restaurant table, crossing her legs and hoping no one could see it. She hid her desperation well as she ordered her food, but while waiting for the food to get there, she fidgeted a bit, sweating a little.

"Are you all right Twilight?" said Spike.

"Of course!" said Twilight, not sounding entirely convincing. "Why wouldn't I be?"

After lunch, which took another hour, Twilight's next item on the agenda was to smile and wave at delegates from Saddle Arabia, back at Canterlot. So, she and Spike boarded the train, Twilight again disappointed to see the train bathroom was still "out of order".

Twilight had to pee really badly, and started fidgeting a little harder than at the restaurant, sweating more and with an uncomfortable look on her face.

"Twilight, are you sure you're all right?" said Spike, who was now worried about her.

"I..." Twilight knew there was no hiding her desperation from Spike at this point. "I really need to go to the bathroom."

"Why are you holding it so long?"

"I haven't had the chance to go yet! Every bathroom's been out of order, or full!"

"Are you gonna be all right?"

"I'll be fine. First chance I get I'll use a bathroom without a doubt."

Upon reaching Canterlot, Twilight ran to the nearest outhouse, but to her dismay many ponies were in line. Each pony took about a minute, and Twilight became increasingly desperate as the line slowly progressed. By the time there were about four ponies in front of her, Twilight realized she would be late for the big event, and ran out of the line.

Spike was riding on her back the entire time. "Really? You couldn't wait for just four more ponies?"

"I don't wanna be late," said Twilight.

"They're not gonna miss anything! All you have to do is smile and wave, remember?"

"Celestia wouldn't have asked me to if it wasn't important!"

As soon as Twilight and Spike were out of sight, Discord snapped his fingers, and the ponies in line - again illusions - vanished.

Twilight stood on a balcony as the delegates from Saddle Arabia arrived. She smiled and waved at them, which took a great deal of effort in her current state.

Next she was attending a Wonderbolt show in Manehattan, which Rainbow Dash was a part of. As she got on the train, she groaned loudly when she saw the "Out of Order" sign was still on the bathroom, unbeknownst to her having been conjured yet again by Discord, who only had the signs up when she was in view, as his little trick was for her and no one else.

The nearest bathroom to the Wonderbolt arena had a big lineup of ponies waiting to see the show.

"Are you gonna stand in the whole lineup this time?" said Spike.

"I could miss the start of the show," said Twilight. "I have to pee so bad!"

She stood in line for minutes, frantically doing the pee dance as the line progressed very slowly. Twilight could feel her desperation increase and she wasn't sure how much longer she could hold it.

When it was finally Twilight's turn, she saw an "Out of Order" sign on the toilet. She didn't stop to think how it got there when no ponies had gone in after the pony in front of her.

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!"

Twilight ran out of the outhouse and flew over to the arena where the Wonderbolts were going to perform. She paused midway to go back for Spike, and upon reaching the arena, sat down and fidgeted harder than ever, sweating profusely and with a pained look on her face. Some of the ponies laughed at seeing Twilight in this position. For some reason they were more at ease making fun of Princess Twilight than Princess Celestia. Twilight didn't notice, however, as all she was paying attention to was how badly she needed to pee.

The Wonderbolts did their show, and Twilight waved in Rainbow Dash's direction at one point, but for the rest of it she didn't even pay attention, as her need to pee was too great.

"What's next?" said Twilight once the show was over.

"Next you had to check the dam to make sure it's not gonna burst," said Spike.

Twilight cringed. The dam would be very close to water.

After another uncomfortable train ride to Ponyville, Twilight flew over to the dam. The sight of the water nearly made her lose it there. She almost considered going for a swim and peeing in the water, but she was disgusted at the thought of it.

Twilight examined the dam for about ten minutes, painfully trying to keep an eye out for any sign of cracks or weakness while simultaneously holding it in.

After coming to the conclusion that the dam was in perfect condition, Twilight flew into the nearby outhouse, but for some reason it didn't have a toilet! What kind of ponies made this outhouse? Frustrated and desperate beyond belief, Twilight ran out.

"I take it you couldn't go?" said Spike.

"I don't know what was up with that outhouse," said Twilight. "What's next?" She had a hard time focusing with how desperate she was.

"Next you're going on a flight with Princess Ember," said Spike.

Twilight moaned. She wasn't sure she could hold it for this flight.

Ember had already been in Ponyville so the arrangement was to meet up at Twilight's castle. Twilight hoped she would have time to use the bathroom before Ember got here, but as soon as she reached her castle, she found Ember standing at the door.

Spike got off Twilight to greet Ember.

"Well, I see you two probably have some catching up to do, so, I'll be back in a minute!" said Twilight, and she ran into her castle.

She ran to the nearest bathroom, but it was locked. She knocked on the door.

"In a minute," came Pinkie Pie's voice. "Oh no! I think I clogged up the toilet!"

Twilight ran to the next nearest bathroom, but it was also locked. Twilight could hear the sound of a shower going on. Why was whoever it was - Starlight maybe? - locking the door for a shower? It wasn't as though ponies ever wore clothes, and they saw each other take baths all the time!

At this point, Twilight realized she would be late for her flight with Ember. Letting out another frustrated cry, she ran back outside.

Discord unlocked the bathroom doors and turned the shower in the second bathroom off. Of course he had also imitated Pinkie Pie's voice, and Starlight was hanging out with Trixie.

Twilight and Ember went on their flight, with Ember giving Spike a ride, much to Twilight's relief, as having to give him a ride put more pressure on her.

Ember talked about how things were going in the dragon kingdom, while Twilight put a lot of effort into holding it in, barely registering anything the dragon lord said.

"So, what about you?" said Ember. "How's things in Ponyville?"

"They're... really great!" said Twilight, who was now dripping with sweat. "Really fun and peaceful, and full of friendship and stuff!"

"Are you all right Twilight?" said Ember. "Why are your legs crossed?"

"She really has to..." began Spike.

"Quiet, Spike!" said Twilight, a little louder than she meant it.

Twilight somehow held it in the entire flight, and Ember didn't comment on Twilight's desperation, although she was sure she must have suspected something. After they said their goodbyes, Twilight asked Spike what was next.

"One last thing - dinner with the griffons!"

Twilight hoped the train bathroom would be fixed on the way to Griffonstone, but that damn sign was still up there! She fidgeted harder than ever, her legs crossed tight.

As soon as they reached Griffonstone, Twilight raced to the nearest outhouse, but it had an Out of Order sign on it. She ran to another one, but it had several ponies in a lineup. Twilight didn't stop to think why the only ponies here besides her were in line for the bathroom, but ran to the restaurant where they were having dinner.

Several griffons sat at a table, Gilda and Grandpa Gruff among them. After taking her seat at the table, Twilight ran to the bathroom, but all the stalls were out of order. Feeling frustrated and more desperate than ever, she ran back to the table and fidgeted the entire time.

"Are you all right, Princess Twilight?" said Gilda.

"I REALLY need to pee!" said Twilight, not bothering to hide it anymore.

"What was wrong with the bathroom?" said Grandpa Gruff.

"All the stalls were out of order! AGAIN! I'll just have to hold it... if I can!"

After what seemed like forever, their meal came. Twilight wolfed it down as fast as she could, and resumed squirming vigorously with her legs crossed.

Once the bill was paid by Grandpa Gruff, Twilight ran back to the train as fast as she could, Spike having to hold onto her to keep from falling off. She checked the train bathroom again, and wasn't surprised to see the sign was still up.

It was sunset when they reached Ponyville, and Twilight flew as fast as she could back to her castle, hoping all the bathrooms would be empty this time.

She ran to the nearest bathroom, but saw Discord enter with a newspaper and close the door just as she was about to reach it.

Twilight was in no mood to run to the next bathroom. She was about to burst. She banged on the door.

"Hurry up! I can't hold on much longer!" She meant it. She knew she was about to reach her limit, and held in her pee with all her effort.

She did the pee dance frantically as her desperation grew. Then, the pressure reached a point where she felt she couldn't hold it in anymore. She was seconds away from peeing herself. To whatever extent, as she wasn't wearing anything.

Discord sensed that Twilight couldn't hold it any longer, so he opened the door and walked outside. Twilight immediately ran into the bathroom, closing the door but forgetting to lock it, sat on the toilet, and finally let go.

"Ahhhhhhhhh", she sighed in immense relief as her pee splashed into the toilet. She could not believe she had held it the whole day.

After just over two minutes, Twilight finished peeing, and flushed the toilet. She walked outside just as Spike reached the door. He could tell from the look on her face that she had finally found relief.

"How was your busy day?" said Discord.

"It was awful!" said Twilight. "I really needed to go to the bathroom, but all the bathrooms were either full, out of order, or had a big lineup!"

"Oh, that's too bad," said Discord. "Well, hopefully you learned to give yourself time for what you need to do!"

"I... guess," said Twilight. All she felt was relief after holding it in so long, and that she made it.

Part 3 now

Fluttershy's Desperation

Fluttershy was always too shy to tell anyone when she needed to use the bathroom. Sometimes this would cause a lot of trouble for her, causing to her to hold for long stretches of time, but she always made it every time. But, one day she would have the longest hold of her life.

After a busy day of taking care of animals, Fluttershy was on her way to the Crystal Empire with Twilight Sparkle, for Twilight wanted to visit with Shining Armor and Princess Cadence, and Fluttershy wanted to go to the petting zoo.

Arriving at the Crystal Empire, Fluttershy and Twilight entered the library, where Twilight began looking at all the books, occasionally picking out a few to read. Fluttershy found a book about animals and began reading it.

Until she felt the urge to pee. She realized she had not gone to the bathroom all day, not even for her morning pee.

Since Twilight was too distracted reading books to see what Fluttershy was doing, Fluttershy thought she could use the library's bathroom without making a fuss.

Except for one thing. She didn't know where the bathroom was.

She could feel her bladder slowly filling up, so she walked up to the librarian. "Um... excuse me."

"Yes?" said the librarian.

"Do you know where I can find... um..."

"Where you can find what?"

"...a book about Breezies?"

"You'll find one on that shelf over there."

Fluttershy walked over to the shelf, still needing to pee. She had chickened out. She was too shy to ask where the bathroom was.

She read the Breezies book so as to not be suspicious, but focused more on how much she needed to pee, eventually putting the book back on the shelf.

Once Twilight had finished reading the books here, she and Fluttershy met up, and they went to Shining Armor and Cadence's castle.

As Twilight was talking with Shining Armor and Cadence, Fluttershy looked over at a bathroom that was in this room. She tiptoed over to the bathroom. The pressure in her bladder was growing each minute, but she was finally about to find relief.

When she tried to open the door, she found that it was locked. Of all the bathrooms in the castle, this one required a key. Who designed this castle?

All she had to do was ask Shining Armor or Cadence for the key, but again, she was too shy to do so. She decided to find another bathroom in the castle that didn't require a key. She walked through the halls, and eventually found a bathroom. She turned the handle of the door and started to open it.

Then she heard a familiar sound. She turned around to see a small bird on the ground. It chirped a bit at her.

"Oh, you poor creature," she said. "Your wing is broken? I'll help you find your nest."

Fluttershy picked up the bird in both hooves and flew around the castle in search of the bird's nest. She still needed to pee, and had been seconds away from relief, but she couldn't turn her back on an animal in need.

After a few uncomfortable minutes of searching, she found the bird's nest somewhere on a balcony of the castle, and made her way back to the bathroom, only to run into Twilight.

"Well, Shining Armor and Cadence have got some stuff to do now, so it's time to go back to Ponyville."

"Sounds good," said Fluttershy, though she didn't think so. She wanted to tell Twilight to wait so she could use the bathroom she had found... but she was still too shy to say it.

They boarded the train back to Ponyville. Fluttershy considered using the train bathroom. She was too shy to tell Twilight this, but her need to pee became greater and greater. She decided to use the train bathroom, and stood up.

"Where are you going?" said Twilight.

"Nowhere," said Fluttershy, sitting down, still too shy to tell Twilight she needed to go to the bathroom.

She held it in for the entire trip, concealing her desperation from Twilight.

As soon as they arrived at Ponyville, Fluttershy ran toward her cottage as fast as she could, but bumped into Rainbow Dash. She almost lost it there but held it in.

"Hey Fluttershy," said Rainbow Dash. "Ready to go to Baltimare?"

Fluttershy had forgotten she and Rainbow Dash were going to watch a show at Baltimare. "When does the train leave?"

"We're flying this time," said Rainbow Dash. "Our wings could use the exercise!"

Fluttershy wanted to ask if the could use the bathroom before they left, but again, she was too shy to say so. So, she and Rainbow Dash flew towards Baltimare. Fluttershy needed to pee badly at this point. She could always ask Rainbow Dash to stop so she could use the bathroom, but she was still unable to.

"Stop!" said Rainbow Dash about halfway through the flight, and she touched down on the ground right next to an outhouse.

"What is it?" said Fluttershy as she reached the ground.

"I have to go to the bathroom real bad!" said Rainbow Dash. "Wait here for a second." Rainbow Dash ran into the outhouse. Fluttershy did the pee dance outside the outhouse, waiting for her to come out. After about a minute, Rainbow Dash emerged. "Do you need the bathroom too?"

"No," said Fluttershy, which was an outright lie, for she really needed to go, but was too shy to tell Rainbow Dash.

"Then let's go!" said Rainbow Dash, and they took off again.

They reached Baltimare, and watched the show. Fluttershy squirmed in her seat for all of it, unable to keep still. Rainbow Dash was too focused on the show to notice. Fluttershy considered sneaking off to the bathroom, but she didn't want Rainbow Dash to feel like she was walking out on her, or to say why she was leaving. So she crossed her legs and held it in.

After an hour, which felt like ten hours to Fluttershy, the show was over, and she and Rainbow Dash flew back to Ponyville. Fluttershy wasn't sure she could hold it for the flight, but she did, though she had both hooves on her crotch the entire time.

Fluttershy ran toward her cottage again, but then caught sight of a clock. It was almost time for her to go to a fashion show with Rarity at Manehattan. Fluttershy ran to the train station, hoping to use the bathroom there before Rarity got there. However, as soon as she got to the station, Rarity was already there.

"Thank goodness," said Rarity. "I almost thought you weren't going to show."

Why did she have to plan these trips with Twilight, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity on the same day? At least she didn't have anything else planned today. She let out a small squeak as she felt the need to pee grow greater, but she hid signs of desperation from Rarity.

"I need to use the little filly's room," said Rarity. "I'll be right back." She ran into the station bathroom. Fluttershy decided she'd find some excuse and use the bathroom as soon as Rarity was out.

However, just as Rarity came out of the bathroom, the train arrived. Fluttershy didn't want Rarity to be late for the fashion show, so without saying anything, she walked onto the train with her.

Fluttershy sat still for the entire trip, in desperate need of a bathroom. She avoided crossing her legs or fidgeting with great difficulty, because she didn't want Rarity to know how badly she needed to go. She didn't want to use the bathroom on the train, because she was too shy to say it, and if she stood up, Rarity would probably ask where she was going, and she didn't want to tell her. She tried to think of some excuse, but she couldn't.

As Fluttershy became even more desperate, she worried about how the fashion show was going to go. She would be trying on one of Rarity's outfits. She wouldn't be the only pony in the fashion show, but if she peed in Rarity's outfit, she'd not only be humiliated onstage, but ruin Rarity's fashion show, and one of her outfits.

As they arrived in Manehattan, Rarity said "Quickly! We must not be late!"

They ran to the building where the fashion show was taking place. Fluttershy was wearing a dress that Rarity designed, which was a relief because it would be easy to take on and off, and would not be damaged if she lost control. Still, she did not want to pee anywhere other than a toilet.

She stood on the stage, feeling nervous about the ponies looking at her. If she peed right here, it would still make a big puddle and all the ponies would see. She crossed her legs, which could not be seen under her dress, feeling the throbbing of her bladder as its pressure grew heavier. She was so nervous that she almost lost it, but she barely managed to hold it in.

After what seemed like hours, Rarity was presented with her trophy, and Fluttershy removed the dress and ran to the nearest bathroom. However, there was a line for it. Fluttershy waited as long as she could, but when she saw Rarity walking around, no doubt in search of her, she ran over to her.

"Congratulations on winning the fashion show Rarity," said Fluttershy, trying to keep the desperation out of her voice, not entirely successfully.

"Are you feeling all right, Fluttershy?" said Rarity, looking a little concerned.

"I'm feeling just fine," said Fluttershy, which of course was not true.

"Then let's go back to Ponyville!" said Rarity.

As they got to the train station, the train hadn't arrived yet.

"Um... Rarity... there's something I'd like to do. I'll be right back."

"All right, darling. The train gets here in three minutes."

Fluttershy ran toward the train station bathroom and entered it. This was a bathroom with three stalls, but to her dismay they were all taken. Fluttershy frantically did the pee dance, now that no one could see her. She needed to pee so badly and she wasn't sure how much longer she could hold it.

She was sure two minutes had gone by when she heard one of the toilets flush. With how much she was holding in she couldn't possibly use the toilet and then return to Rarity in just one minute. So, very reluctantly, she ran back over to Rarity.

The train arrived, and Fluttershy and Rarity got onto the train. Fluttershy was more desperate than she had ever been in her life. She couldn't hold it much longer. There was no hiding her desperation this time. She crossed her legs and fidgeted, biting her lower lip.

Naturally, this did not go unnoticed by Rarity. "Fluttershy, darling, if you need to use the bathroom, you should just say so."

Fluttershy blushed.

"You can use the bathroom on this train."

Feeling a little relieved, Fluttershy ran over to the train bathroom, but to her horror it had an "Out of Order" sign on it.

"No..." Fluttershy whimpered. She returned to Rarity and sat beside her.

"Are you feeling better, Fluttershy?" said Rarity.

Fluttershy shook her head. "It's out of order..."

"I hope you can hold it until we get to Ponyville," said Rarity.

Fluttershy became more desperate with each minute, squirming hard and feeling the pee slosh around inside her.

After what seemed like an eternity, they reached Ponyville. It was around sunset at this time. Fluttershy ran toward her cottage as fast as she could. This time she was going to get to her bathroom and find much-needed relief!

"Fluttershy!" came a familiar voice.

Fluttershy turned around to see Applejack running up to her.

"I'm so glad you're here," said Applejack. "Some varmint rabbits are stealin' my apples! Can you go talk some sense into them?"

Fluttershy didn't want to. She wanted to run into her cottage and get to her bathroom. She wanted to tell Applejack this, but she was too shy to say it to her, even after Rarity had noticed her desperation. She nodded her head, her eyes tearing up.

Applejack led Fluttershy to the rabbits, who stuck their tongues out at Applejack.

"SHAME ON YOU!" said Fluttershy. "Stealing Applejack's apples! Return them AT ONCE and don't let me EVER CATCH YOU DOING THAT AGAIN!"

The rabbits quickly set the apples down and ran. Fluttershy felt a little bad about yelling at them. She'd usually try to ask nicely first, but she needed to pee so badly she was in no mood to put up with the rabbits' antics. She'd have to apologize to them for being so harsh once she had finally relieved herself.

"Wow, that was... effective," said Applejack, taken aback a bit by Fluttershy's rage. "Thanks, Fluttershy. Ah don't think they'll be stealin' my apples ever again."

Fluttershy felt a bit better knowing she had definitely helped Applejack. "I'd better get home now."

Applejack nodded, and Fluttershy ran as fast as Rainbow Dash toward her cottage. She knew she was about to burst, and she couldn't spare another second.

She reached her cottage and ran toward her bathroom as fast as she could. The pressure was at its heaviest and she knew she had reached her limit. She ran into the bathroom, closed the door behind her, sat on the toilet, and finally let go.

She let out a very satisfied sigh of relief as her pee splashed into the toilet. The relief felt absolutely delicious. She could not believe she had held it for almost a full day. There had been many times where she thought she wasn't going to make it, and she was very relieved that she had. She could not imagine how humiliating it would be to wet herself, even if she wasn't wearing anything.

After about a minute and 40 seconds, Fluttershy finished peeing. Immensely relieved that her bladder was now empty after holding it in for so long, she flushed the toilet and decided to go relax with her pets.

If only she could get over her bladder shyness, she could save a lot of trouble.

*008*2018-06-04 00:59

Thanks for reminding me I was putting these here, I got sidetracked and forgot. (Yeah, this isn't really my style, with a.) Them not wearing anything, and b.) Desperation with no wetting, but they were requested on fimfiction and only I was willing to answer his requests. So, here's Part 4!

Rainbow Dash and Applejack's Desperation

Rainbow Dash and Applejack finished a day of competitive sports. Exhausted, hot, and sweaty, they decided to cool down by drinking some cider at Sweet Apple Acres.

They talked for a while, until, on their fourth cider...

"I have to pee," said Rainbow Dash. "I've been holding it for a while."

Rainbow Dash ran into the nearest bathroom on the farm. After about half a minute, she came back out.

"Much better! Hey, remember that time Rarity held her pee all day? That was something I didn't expect to see RARITY do, and I have to admit, it was really fun teasing her about it, with all the waterfalls!"

"That reminds me," said Applejack. "One time ah talked with Spike, and he said that Twilight also had to hold it all day cause she never had the chance to get to a bathroom."

"Oh, I heard about that from Gilda! She said she saw Twilight pretty desperate when they were having dinner together at Griffonstone!"

"And once ah called Fluttershy to help with some animals, and she looked really impatient. Ah didn't say anythin' cause ah didn't wanna make her uncomfortable, but ah noticed she was really desperate to pee."

"So all three of them had to hold it for a really long time."

"Ah wonder which of the six of us could last the longest?"

"Totally me!" Rainbow Dash bragged. "I would obviously be the one who could hold it longer than any of you!"

"You might be able to hold it longer than Pinkie Pie, and MAYBE the other three, but not me! Most mares in the Apple Family have bladders of steel, and ah'm no exception!"

"Oh yeah? Then prove it! Let's have a competition tomorrow! We'll both drink lots of cider in the morning, and then hold it all day to see who can hold it longer!"

"Ah accept. And ah know ah'm gonna win!"

They spit on their hooves and did a hoof bump.

...

The next day, Rainbow Dash and Applejack met up at Sweet Apple Acres before sunrise. At 6:00 AM, they drank as much cider as they could, until neither could drink anymore. Rainbow Dash still wanted to win, but either way she loved getting the chance to drink so much cider.

Not long after sunrise, Rainbow Dash and Applejack already needed to pee. They both hid this from the other, not wanting to show any weakness so early in.

"Let's stay together the entire day to make sure neither of us uses the bathroom," said Applejack.

"Fine with me!" said Rainbow Dash.

They stood still for a long time, neither showing any sign of desperation.

"7:00! It's been one hour." Rainbow Dash sat down because standing was getting tiring. Applejack did the same, though they sat still, keeping track of the time so they knew how long they were holding it for.

Around 8:00, they began pacing around Sweet Apple Acres, though still showing no signs of how much they needed to go.

Finally, at about 9:00 AM, Applejack had her back legs really tight together. Rainbow Dash made sure Applejack was looking the other way, and crossed her legs tight, uncrossing them as soon as she was looking in her direction again.

Over the next hour, their need to pee increased, and they had a harder time concealing it, crossing their legs at every opportunity.

"10:00," said Applejack. "Let's go to Ponyville."

They walked into Ponyville, trying not to look desperate in front of the other ponies. Over the next two hours they walked through Ponyville, doing a few activities they planned to do today, all the while becoming more desperate. None of the ponies noticed their desperation.

After two hours, which seemed like two days to the desperate mares, they returned to Sweet Apple Acres and had lunch together, eating apples and hay burgers.

"Well, it's been six hours," said Rainbow Dash. "And I know I'm gonna win. UHHH!" She crossed her legs tightly.

"You were sayin'?" said Applejack. A twinge in her own bladder made her cross her legs tightly.

They ate their food rather rushed. Rainbow Dash could not keep herself from fidgeting when she was halfway done, and after about a minute, Applejack started fidgeting too.

Eventually, they finished, and as they walked back to Ponyville, holding their legs tightly together, Pinkie Pie suddenly ran right in front of them. Rainbow Dash and Applejack were startled and almost lost it there.

"Hey Rainbow Dash! Hey Applejack! Wanna come to a super super fun random party with me?"

"Sure," said Rainbow Dash nervously. "We'd love to!"

They ran to Sugarcube Corner at top speed. A few of the background ponies were there as well, and Pinkie began the party.

"Too bad none of the others could come," said Pinkie.

"Feel like usin' the bathroom here?" said Applejack quietly to Rainbow Dash.

"Not even a little bit!" said Rainbow Dash, but she was crossing her legs tightly.

They tried to hide their desperation and enjoy the party, though Applejack nearly lost it when she tripped and fell on Pin the Tail on the Pony, and Rainbow Dash was even more uncomfortable bobbing for apples, due to the water.

"Hey, are you two all right?" said Pinkie Pie. "You look really antsy about something."

"We're fine," said Rainbow Dash, sweating a bit.

At about 1:30, the party ended, and Rainbow Dash and Applejack ran back to Sweet Apple Acres, and sat down for a moment.

"What's the matter Rainbow, you can't hold it much longer?" said Applejack as Rainbow Dash was crossing her legs tightly and fidgeting a lot.

"Of course I can!" said Rainbow Dash. "In fact, I could even drink more cider and still beat you!" She drank two more mugs of cider, and looked at Applejack, who was crossing her legs very tightly and biting her lower lip. "What about you, AJ? Can you hold it long enough with a bit of extra cider?"

"Of course I can!" Applejack drank two more mugs of cider as well.

After about ten minutes, Rainbow Dash and Applejack could see each other getting more desperate, unable to hide it anymore. So, Rainbow Dash grabbed another cider and chugged it down. Looking a little nervous for a split second, Applejack did the same.

"It's almost 2:00!" said Rainbow Dash. "That means we held it for..." She paused to cross her legs tighter when she felt another twinge in her bladder. "Almost eight hours!"

"2:00?" said Applejack. "We were gonna try on outfits for Rarity at 2:00!"

They raced to Carousel Boutique, arriving at about 1:55.

"You're a bit early, but that's fine by me!" said Rarity, and she showed them each five new outfits they would be trying on.

"Ah can't wait," said Applejack, sounding more nervous and crossing her legs tight.

"Applejack, I thought you were all right with this."

"Ah am," said Applejack, pretending to be cheerful.

"Can we hurry this up?" said Rainbow Dash, who was fidgeting hard.

"Do you need to use the bathroom?" said Rarity, beginning to understand Applejack's initial reaction.

"No," said Rainbow Dash, crossing her legs and sweating.

"If you have to go, you can use the bathroom right here," said Rarity.

"We can hold it," said Applejack.

"You'd better," said Rarity. "I will be very miffed if you... go... in one of these outfits."

The first two outfits were dresses, like the ones they wore to the gala. These were easy to put on and take off, and plus, it would be hard for them to get wet if either of them lost it.

The next outfits were sparkly jumpsuits, but not too tight. Both were white, with blue sparkles for Rainbow Dash and orange sparkles for Applejack.

The next ones were skintight sparkly jumpsuits, which were torture for Applejack and Rainbow Dash to put on. Applejack's was dark red, Rainbow Dash's was dark blue. The tightness put some extra pressure on their bladders, and they crossed their legs very tight.

"Aw, you look so cute," said Rarity. "But don't wet those outfits!" she said in a more stern voice.

Rainbow Dash and Rarity were relieved to change out of these outfits. The last ones were sports outfits, consisting of T-shirts and skintight compression shorts - Moderate shade of blue T-shirt and dark blue shorts for Rainbow Dash, yellow T-shirt and red shorts for Applejack. These were even tighter on them than the previous ones and they both crossed their legs, fidgeting hard.

Rarity giggled for a bit. "You look smashing!"

"Is it over now?" said Rainbow Dash.

Rarity remembered the time Rainbow Dash had teased her when she had needed to go. "Applejack, you're good to go. Rainbow Dash, stand for another five minutes so I can make sure I fashioned them exactly to my liking."

"But what if I have an accident?"

"I shouldn't have been so fussy. It IS your outfit now, after all."

Rainbow Dash crossed her legs tight and fidgeted, biting her lower lip, while Rarity walked around her, examining every inch of her outfit.

"Everything's perfect!" said Rarity after the five minutes, slapping Rainbow's butt. Rainbow squealed and nearly lost it there, but she managed to hold it in.

Rainbow Dash quickly pulled her outfit off, then she and Applejack ran to Sweet Apple Acres with their new outfits.

"I'll leave mine here for now," said Rainbow Dash. "I'll take them home once I've won the contest!"

"You mean once I'VE won the contest!" said Applejack.

"Yeah, I don't think you can last much longer," said Rainbow Dash, feigning confidence while she was really more desperate than she had ever been in her life. "Especially with this!" She drank three more mugs of cider and gave Applejack a smug look.

Applejack drank three mugs of cider as well.

At about 2:45, Rainbow Dash started looking more nervous. "I REALLY thought you wouldn't last this long. I'm flying with the Wonderbolts in 15 minutes!"

"That'll be fun," said Applejack.

"What if I wet my flight suit in front of everyone? What if they kick me out? What if... Pull it together, Rainbow Dash! This'll be a snap! It's not like I haven't had to fly while needing to pee before!" But I haven't had to pee this badly before either!

"Where are you flyin'?" said Applejack.

"At Canterlot!" said Rainbow Dash.

They quickly boarded the train. Though the train ride was not long, they crossed their legs tight and fidgeted hard for the entire ride, sweating profusely.

"Princess Celestia's gonna be there," said Applejack. "You think you can hold it and perform well in front of her?"

"In my sleep!" said Rainbow Dash, but deep down she felt so nervous she almost peed right there.

They reached Canterlot, and Rainbow Dash and Applejack ran as fast as they could. Rainbow would have loved to fly, but she had to stay in sight of Applejack.

Frantically doing the pee dance, Applejack kept her eye on Rainbow Dash as she put on her Wonderbolts outfit. Rainbow Dash stood beside Spitfire and Soarin, ready to perform.

"Hey Rainbow Dash, you all right?" said Spitfire.

Rainbow Dash just nodded, crossing her legs and trying her hardest not to fidget.

"You should have gotten here earlier. Then you'd have had time to use the bathroom before the performance."

"I can hold it."

The Wonderbolts did their performance, showing off many great flight patterns. Applejack sat in the bleachers, her legs crossed tight, and biting her lower lip.

Rainbow Dash tried to forget about her desperation, and she performed her flight, if not as awesome as usual, at least above average.

Her flight suit was soaked with sweat, from a combination of holding it in and flying hard. Applejack briefly suspected she might have peed in her suit, but she realized if she did, it still would have been easy to notice, as she had watched her the entire time.

"What a wonderful show," said Princess Celestia as she walked up to the Wonderbolts once they stood still. She whispered into Rainbow Dash's ear. "Now that the show's over, you can find a bathroom. You must have to go really bad."

Rainbow Dash blushed a little, but peeled off her Wonderbolt suit and flew over to Applejack. "All right, we're done here! Let's go!"

After another very uncomfortable train journey, they were back in Ponyville, where they continued to hold it. They both had to pee so badly they could not believe they had held it in this time. Neither had tested their bladder's strength this much before.

"4:00," said Applejack, looking at the clock. "Ten hours! Feel like losin' yet?"

"I could hold it all day!" said Rainbow Dash. She put both hooves on her crotch, and Applejack laughed.

"Hey Rainbow Dash!" said Twilight Sparkle as she flew in. "I just got the new Daring Do book! Shall we read it together?"

"Uh... I'm kinda in the middle of... I mean... sure!"

"I'll come too," said Applejack. "Who doesn't like a good story from time to time?"

Twilight led her two desperate friends to her castle, and read the first chapter of the new book.

"All right Rainbow Dash, you read now!" said Twilight. "Rainbow Dash? Are you all right?"

Rainbow Dash held the book in front of her in an attempt to hide her crossed legs, but she couldn't keep herself from sweating and fidgeting slightly. Applejack was in the same position, except with no book in her hooves she couldn't hide the position of her legs.

"Do you two have to go to the bathroom?" said Twilight. "I once held it all day. It wasn't very fun. You should go now. You know where the bathrooms are."

"Nah, I can hold it." Rainbow Dash wasn't so sure. She could feel waves of pee sloshing around in her, and so could Applejack.

"Are you sure?"

"I'm just too excited to re-read this book!"

"Well, if you say so."

Rainbow Dash read the second chapter really fast. As she and Twilight read, Rainbow found it harder to focus on the book, as her bladder was throbbing with intense pain. She was thankful she'd read it already so she didn't have to really miss anything.

Applejack wasn't even terribly interested in the books, so this was even harder for her. All she could focus on was how badly she needed to pee.

By 5:00, the book was done.

"This was really fun Twilight, gotta go!" Rainbow Dash ran out the door, Applejack right behind her.

"Hey, aren't you gonna go to the bathroom first?" said Twilight. "They can be so stubborn."

...

"You feeling like peeing yet?" said Rainbow Dash to Applejack, back at Sweet Apple Acres.

"Not even a little bit." This wasn't exactly the most honest thing she had said, but she didn't want Rainbow Dash to know how desperate she was. However, her body language said it all.

"Anything else we have to do today?" Rainbow Dash asked this partially to distract herself a bit.

"At 5:30 I'm havin' tea at the new restaurant with Rarity and Fluttershy. They said ah could invite any ponies ah want."

"That'll make things interesting!" said Rainbow Dash. "And so will this!" She drank another mug of cider, and Applejack did the same.

At 5:30, they sat around a table at the tea restaurant with Fluttershy and Rarity. They couldn't help but notice that Rarity was fidgeting, though not as hard as they were.

"Um... Rarity, I think you should probably use the little filly's room," said Fluttershy timidly.

"No, I refuse to use a public washroom." Rarity crossed her legs.

Applejack and Rainbow Dash grimaced. Rarity's desperation, though obviously not as great as their own, reminded them of it, making their need to pee worse.

Rarity hoped Rainbow Dash wouldn't get back at her for last time by teasing her. But, she looked like she was in no fit state to. She must not have had the chance to go all day. A part of her thought it served her right, but they had (mostly) put this behind them now and she hoped she made it.

"Ah'll get the biggest cup of tea you got!" said Applejack.

"Are you sure?" said Fluttershy. "You... um... you look like you really... never mind." She blushed. "But, you can always go there." She pointed at the bathroom.

"No, I... I don't like using public washrooms," said Rainbow Dash.

"It's never been a problem before," said Fluttershy.

"Um... Rarity's rubbed off on us," said Rainbow Dash. "But, we'll probably get over it by tonight! Ow! I really need to pee!"

Applejack said nothing, but fidgeted harder.

Fluttershy and Rarity sipped their tea while Rainbow Dash and Applejack drained their teacups in one gulp and asked for another.

At about 6:00, Applejack said "Well, time for us to get some dinner!" She threw a few bits to Fluttershy. "That's for what we got." Then she and Rainbow Dash ran back to Sweet Apple Acres.

Both mares felt like they were about to burst, but neither was ready to give up. They each wanted to beat the other.

Applejack made the dinner for her and Rainbow Dash, a big selection of apple treats along with a sandwich. Her legs were crossed the entire time, and she was sweating quite a bit.

"Think you can make it?" said Rainbow Dash, fidgeting hard in her seat.

"Ah know ah can!" said Applejack.

"You two still need to go to the bathroom?"

Applejack and Rainbow Dash turned to see Apple Bloom in the doorway.

"Uh, yeah, but we can hold it!"

Apple Bloom didn't say anything, for she had overheard them talking about their competition.

After dinner, they stayed in their living room, trying their best not to burst.

"Ready to give up?" said Rainbow Dash.

"Not yet," said Applejack.

"I don't think you can hold it another minute!"

"Ah bet you can't last five seconds!"

Their desperation increased to a critical point, and they both put their hooves on their crotches, fidgeting more vigorously than ever with their legs crossed as tightly as they could.

"You OK Dash?" said Applejack at 9:00 PM, noticing Rainbow Dash's extremely desperate state.

Rainbow Dash couldn't hide her desperation even the slightest anymore. "I can't hold it anymore! I'm going to burst!"

"Me neither! Ah can't wait anymore!"

"Should we declare this a tie and just go pee?"

"Yeah, let's do that."

As fast as their legs would carry them, Rainbow Dash and Applejack each entered a different outhouse. After about two minutes, both exited the outhouse, feeling immensely relieved.

"We held it for 15 hours," said Rainbow Dash, looking at the clock.

"I'm mighty impressed you were able to hold it as long as me," said Applejack. "After all we had to drink."

"I don't think anyone can hold it as long as us!"

They did a hoof bump.
