Someone wants more bondage stories so I thought this might be a good place to start.

Warning: This story has her stink really bad from not washing for a long time, if you're not into that, I will do a shorter version of the story in my first reply. However, she does NOT mess herself.

Princess Daisy Tied and Desperate

Princess Daisy was running laps at a racetrack in Sarasaland. Her exercise outfit, a yellow tank top and short skintight orange shorts, were very sweaty, as was the rest of her. But she was always a very fast runner. She eventually sat down on the grass to take a break, drinking a lot of water. She had just finished her fifth water bottle when a UFO flew above and abducted her. She remembered very little inside the UFO, as a sleeping gas entered the chamber and she fell asleep.

She woke up tied to a chair inside an unfamiliar looking castle. Her hands were tied behind her back and her feet were tied together. Sitting on a throne at the end of the castle was her old kidnapper, Tatanga.

"Tatanga!" said Daisy. "I thought Mario defeated you!"

"Mario destroyed both my ships so it took a while to get back here, but now I'm back! I will make you my queen and rule your kingdom!"

"Mario defeated you twice and he'll do it again!"

"He doesn't know where we are! This time I took you to my home planet where he'll never look!"

"I've picked up a few tricks since last time! I fought Bowser alongside him at Flower Kingdom and I defeated many of his minions!"

"You can't do anything to me tied up like that! You're staying in that seat until you agree to marry me!"

"I'll never marry you!"

"Have it your way. Whether it takes a day, a week, a month, a year, or ten years, you will be mine!"

Daisy sat in her chair, refusing to accept Tatanga's proposal. Tatanga gave her soda, water, and juice which seemed to have everything she needed. At least he wasn't giving her really bad food. But it was still a prison. She didn't smell too pleasant either, as she had not washed from how much she sweated during her laps.

Pretty soon, Daisy's drinks went through her. She had to pee. "Let me out of here! I have to go to the bathroom!"

"Say you'll marry me," said Tatanga.

"Never!"

"Suit yourself. But you're not getting any bathroom breaks until you say yes."

"I'd rather pee my pants than marry you!"

"Those are your only two options."

Tatanga sat on his throne sipping wine as he watched Daisy squirm. Daisy's need to pee grew more and more urgent. She couldn't even hold herself or cross her legs, so all she could do was fidget in her seat. Soon she really had to go. She nearly asked Tatanga to let her out again, but she knew what his answer would be, and didn't want to give him the satisfaction. So she sat and fidgeted with a pained expression on her face.

"Is the princess about to have an accident?" said Tatanga. "You know what you have to do to avoid that."

"Screw you, Tatanga!" said Daisy. She'd give him the middle finger if her hands weren't tied. She tried to sit still so Tatanga couldn't see her squirm, but her bladder was very full and Tatanga was right, she felt like she could burst at any second.

Eventually, she couldn't hold it any longer. Daisy peed herself, her shorts getting soaked at the crotch and butt. Her chair was flooded as waterfalls flowed off her chair and formed a puddle. The relief felt amazing, but Daisy blushed with embarrassment. She couldn't believe she had just wet herself. But still, it was better than the alternative.

"Looks like some princess was a potty pants," said Tatanga.

Daisy moaned as she finished peeing. Her shorts were absolutely soaked and smelled of fresh urine.

"One little word and I'll give you a bath," said Tatanga.

"Why would you want to marry a girl who just peed herself?" asked Daisy.

"That doesn't bother me. Although, you will want to wash up before the wedding. I'm not into foul smells."

"If I'm here a while that will be a problem."

"Nothing a bath can't fix."

...

Days went by. Daisy sat in her seat, drinking the water, juice, and soda Tatanga gave her. Whenever she had to pee, she just went in her shorts. She didn't put up any resistance any more, knowing it would be useless. Maybe it was the drinks he was giving her, but her pee smelled strongly, and she had to pee a lot each day, and so it wasn't long before her shorts stank rancidly. She didn't smell much better, as she wasn't washing and her armpits really smelled. At least she didn't mess herself, that would be a lot more unpleasant.

"How can you stand me smelling like this?" said Daisy.

"I have an air freshener field around my throne," said Tatanga. "And I'll wear a gas mask when I bathe you. When you agree to marry me."

"You can take your proposal to the foulest corner of the Underwhere!" said Daisy.

"I think I know the foulest corner of YOUR underwear," said Tatanga with a smirk.

"At least you haven't put me in diapers," said Daisy. She was counting on Tatanga untying her feet to put the diaper on so that she could escape.

Tatanga waved a magic rod and a diaper suddenly appeared over top of Daisy's shorts. "There, all diapered up! Now you won't be making any more puddles. Until the diaper leaks, of course."

Daisy groaned and peed herself again. The diaper contained everything... for now.

...

Weeks went by. Daisy remained in her seat, drinking everything Tatanga gave her, and using her shorts as a toilet. Her diaper leaked a day after Tatanga put it on her.

Eventually, it was a little over a month. Daisy stank so bad that even skunks wouldn't want to go near her. Her body odor was so foul that flies were buzzing around her, and her shorts were supersaturated with pee. She had hoped Mario or someone would find their way here and rescue her, or that Tatanga would get too disgusted by the state she was in and let her go, but neither seemed like it would happen anytime soon. So, after peeing again, she tried to think of a way to escape.

"Whatever you do, PLEASE don't put me in a pink onesie!" said Daisy, who looked very tired and like she'd never be energetic again.

"Hehe, minions, you know what to do," said Tatanga.

The enemies walked in with a cute adult-sized pink onesie and walked over to Daisy, wearing gas masks. They untied Daisy's hands, got her out of her seat, and untied her feet to try to put the onesie on. Daisy immediately kicked the enemies, knocking their gas masks off so they could smell her. Their faces turned green and some of them threw up.

"You fools!" said Tatanga. "Be more careful when you untie her!" Though he had to admit to himself, he had thought Daisy was in no fit state to fight back anymore, he had no idea she was merely pretending to throw him off guard.

"Too late for that!" said Daisy. She ripped off her diaper, revealing her soggy, stinky shorts underneath, and jumped on Tatanga's head. Tatanga fell out of the air freshener field of his throne, and Daisy walked up to him.

Tatanga caught a very unpleasant whiff of her and his face turned green. "Phew! You stink so bad I think I'm gonna throw up!"

"We both know whose fault that is," said Daisy. "Now, this is just a taste of what you'll get if you go anywhere near me again!" She grabbed Tatanga and forced his face into her smelly butt. Her shorts smelled of a month's worth of sweat, body odor, and pee. It was too much for Tatanga and he fainted dead away.

As Daisy made her way out of Tatanga's palace, some of his minions tried to stop her but their faces turned green as they got near the smelly princess. Most of them kept their distance from her after that. She jumped into the cockpit of Tatanga's ship that he had abducted her in, and flew back to Earth.

Tatanga woke up, still feeling sick to his stomach. "I am never going anywhere near that princess again. I'd rather deal with Mario again than her!" He stumbled to the bathroom to take a long cold shower.

Daisy landed the ship at Sarasaland Castle and walked in through the front door.

"Princess Daisy, you're back!" said the Chancellor of Sarasaland. "What happened to you?"

"Tatanga kidnapped me again and tied me to a chair until I agreed to marry him," said Daisy. "Seeing how I haven't washed or found a bathroom, you can probably guess whether I did."

"Yes," said the Chancellor awkardly. "Princess, well... how do I say this delicately..."

"I stink really bad and I desperately need a bath," said Daisy. She didn't feel too ashamed of the state she was in, as she had somewhat gotten used to it, and she was just glad to be back at her castle.

"Well... yes," said the Chancellor, seeming relieved that he didn't have to say it, and that Daisy wasn't standing super close to him.

So she took a bath in her stinky outfit, sighing of immense relief at finally getting clean. She spent extra time washing her butt, coating her stinky shorts in suds. Finally, she was clean, though her shorts still had a few stains, and her underwear, a plain white pair of panties, were now heavily stained yellow.

She told her story to the people of Sarasaland, finding it funny in hindsight, and was particularly enthusiastic about how she had defeated Tatanga. Eventually she changed into her yellow pajamas with white and green flowers on them, climbed into her bed, and fell asleep.

When she woke up she felt her pajama pants. They were wet, and there was a pee smell in the room. She had wet the bed. It was a bit embarrassing for her, but at least her bladder control during the day had stayed somehow, aside from a few accidents on her first day back. Although it was a few weeks before she stopped wetting the bed, she came to stop being embarrassed and find it funny and enjoyable.

And if olfactophilia really puts you off: (though pee smells will be retained of course)

Princess Daisy Tied and Desperate (Shorter Version)

Princess Daisy was running laps at a racetrack in Sarasaland. Her exercise outfit, a yellow tank top and short skintight orange shorts, were very sweaty, as was the rest of her. But she was always a very fast runner. She eventually sat down on the grass to take a break, drinking a lot of water.

"Tatanga!" said Daisy. "I thought Mario defeated you!"

"Mario destroyed both my ships so it took a while to get back here, but now I'm back! I will make you my queen and rule your kingdom!"

"Mario defeated you twice and he'll do it again!"

"One little word and I'll give you a bath," said Tatanga.

"Why would you want to marry a girl who just peed herself?" asked Daisy.

"That doesn't bother me."

...

For the rest of the day, Daisy had to pee a lot from the drinks Tatanga gave her, and whenever she had to go, she went in her shorts. She didn't want to give Tatanga the satisfaction of seeing her squirm again.

At the beginning of the second day, Daisy said "I hope you don't put me in diapers."

"Hehe, minions, put a diaper on her!"

Tatanga's minions walked up to her with a diaper and untied her feet. Daisy quickly kicked them to the ground, stood up, and jumped on Tatanga's head, knocking him down. She then sat on Tatanga's face. Her shorts smelled strongly of pee, and he did not enjoy it at all.

"If you want me to let him go, untie me!" said Daisy.

Tatanga's minions quickly untied Daisy's hands, and she stood up. "Tatanga, if you ever kidnap me again, I'll wait a month before making my move. You'll either throw up or faint from my stench. Be thankful it was just pee-soaked shorts this time!"

Tatanga shuddered. "Fine. Leave this place and never return!"

Daisy got into Tatanga's new ship and flew it back to Sarasaland Castle and walked in through the front door.

"Princess Daisy, you're back!" said the Chancellor of Sarasaland. "What happened to you?"

"Tatanga kidnapped me again and tied me to a chair until I agreed to marry him," said Daisy. "I was able to escape, but, well, I might have had a few accidents along the way, hehe." She blushed lightly, but in hindsight now that it was over she found it kind of funny.

"Yes," said the Chancellor awkardly. "May I suggest you take a bath?"

"Oh, definitely!" said Daisy. So she took a bath in her wet shorts, sighing of immense relief at finally getting clean. She spent extra time washing her butt, coating her stinky shorts in suds. Finally, she was clean, though her underwear, a plain white pair of panties, were now heavily stained yellow.
