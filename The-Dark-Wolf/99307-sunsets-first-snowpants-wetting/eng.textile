I thought I'd write a snowpants wetting story for fimfiction, and I think I remember there is someone here who loves Sunset wettings, so I'll post it here. Because a lot of us know how fun snowpants wettings are.

An Equestria Girls fanfic.

Sunset's First Snowpants Wetting

It was a mild winter day. Rainbow Dash and Sunset Shimmer were skiing together. They were wearing their winter outfits, with Rainbow wearing her skintight black pants underneath, and Sunset wearing jeans underneath.

After skiing down a massive slope, Rainbow and Sunset sat down in the snow to rest for a bit.

"That was awesome!" said Rainbow Dash. "When we get back up, let's go down that hill again!"

"That sounds fun," said Sunset. But at this moment, she felt an all too familiar sensation: She had to go to the bathroom. There was a bathroom relatively close by. But this reminded Sunset of something that she had been itching to know.

"Rainbow Dash, remember that snowball fight where you were inside a snowman for two days to get a sneak attack?"

"The sneak attack that didn't work?" Rainbow said indignantly.

"Well, it might have worked if you didn't loudly shout 'Sneak attack!' before throwing the snowball.

"Point taken."

"I've been thinking. Two days is a long time to go without a bathroom. Did you... um... pee in your snowpants?"

"You bet I did," said Rainbow unabashedly. "Do you think I'd cancel my awesome sneak attack for a bathroom break? And with all the coffee and energy drinks I drank to stay awake, I peed more than once." She chuckled.

"So... you were willing to pee in your snowpants just to get a sneak attack?" Sunset had never heard of anyone willingly wetting themselves before.

"Well... There's kind of more to it than that. You'll probably think I'm weird, and I've only ever told Fluttershy."

"Now I'm curious. What more is there to it?" Sunset felt her need to pee increase a bit, and fidgeted slightly.

"It wasn't my first time. Far from it. For years, whenever I'd be having fun playing in the snow, doing winter sports, or hanging out with you at a snow fort or something like that, whenever I have to pee, I just go in my snowpants."

"You wet your snowpants all the time? Why?"

"I'm having so much fun outside, and I don't want to take the time to go inside and remove multiple layers of clothing. The last time I did that, I felt it was a major inconvenience. So, far more easier to just pee my snowpants and be done with it."

"But your snowpants always looked dry every winter."

"They only get wet on the inside. They don't show wetness on the outside. And you never saw me take them off so you didn't see how wet my pants were underneath. So not only is it convenient, but no one can even tell. Like I said, I told Fluttershy, and she thinks it's kind of cute."

The talk of wetness made Sunset's need to pee grow more, but she was very intrigued by Rainbow's story. "Do you know of anyone else who wets their snowpants for convenience?"

"Not in person," said Rainbow. "Maybe Pinkie Pie, I've seen her a little fidgety at the beginning of some winter outdoors and then heard her sigh in relief, and I could've sworn I saw some steam coming off her snowpants, which is what happens when you pee outside. But she almost doesn't count."

Sunset had to agree there. Pinkie did all kinds of weird things and the girls had learned to just go with this without giving it too much thought. Given what Rainbow said, it was most likely that Pinkie also wet her snowpants on a regular basis. She did wet the bed sometimes, after all, and laugh about it, and Sunset had dismissed it as her just being Pinkie Pie.

"But," continued Rainbow, "I got curious so I looked it up online and it sounds like there are lots of people in the world who wet their snowpants for convenience. And they also like how it's easy to hide."

"I had no idea this was actually a thing. It sounds very interesting. Is it... unpleasant?"

Rainbow blushed lightly but smiled. "Kinda the opposite. After doing this for years, it's hard to ignore how good the warm release feels. Maybe it's cause I don't mind getting wet, but the warm wetness spreading through my snowpants... You won't know unless you've done it."

"I'm thinking about it," said Sunset. "I have to go right now." Badly, in fact.

"So, why not go in your snowpants?"

"I'm really curious now about how it feels, if it's that good. Can we... go together?"

"That would be a little difficult," said Rainbow. "I already went when we were skiing down the hill." She chuckled.

"Oh. Well, if you're already wet..." Sunset tried to pee, but was having a bit of difficulty.

"It can be hard the first time since your body is trained to not pee in your pants," said Rainbow.

"Funny how that works because when I first came here from Equestria, I didn't realize I was wearing panties the first time I went to the bathroom." She strongly suspected that Princess Twilight had had the same mishap on her first trip to this world. "At the time all I could think was how embarrassing it was and hoping no one would notice, and not how it actually felt."

"Just think of how it will feel," said Rainbow. "The warm release, the wetness spreading through your snowpants, how warm and wet it will be, and if all else fails, think of the sound of your stream splashing into the toilet."

Sunset had to pee so badly that it actually didn't take long to convince her bladder to let go. Sunset began peeing her snowpants, feeling the warm wetness soak her rear end and spread through the inside her her snowpants. She blushed, feeling a bit foolish at deliberately wetting herself, but she couldn't deny that it felt very good. The relief, the warmth, even a bit of excitement at doing something "naughty" without anyone knowing, except Rainbow Dash, who was sitting beside her in equally wet snowpants, and not for the first time.

As she peed, a hissing noise could be heard, and steam came off of her snowpants. Sunset blushed a little more, but also felt a bit of excitement at this.

Eventually, she finished wetting her snowpants and sighed of relief. "That's better." Her jeans and snowpants were very wet, never mind her black boyshort panties, but she didn't really mind this either. Quite the opposite, actually. She remembered that time she was in the rain in her Backstage Pass pants, and decided that for her next snowpants wetting, she would wear those underneath.

"Did you enjoy your first snowpants wetting?" Rainbow asked with a smile.

"Yes," said Sunset. "I just wish I'd thought of this sooner. All the times I ran to the bathroom and spent so much time removing my snowpants and my jeans... One of them was a near miss, too. If I had known how amazing this felt..."

"Yeah, it's the best," said Rainbow. "So, you're gonna do it again in the future?"

"All the time," said Sunset. "I mean, of course, my jeans are wet now too, but I can always change when I get home."

"Sometimes I don't change when I get home," said Rainbow with a mischievous smile. "Of course I do always wash up and put on a clean pair of pants for the next day. I know Rarity doesn't like it when I smell too unpleasant. I still remember that time she gave me a bath in my stinky shorts after not washing for days." She chuckled a bit, finding it funny to look back to.

"That reminds me. Have you ever messed in your snowpants?"

"Once, inside the snowman."

"And was that enjoyable too?"

"It was kind of fun at the time, but the cleanup was pretty annoying. You can try it if you want, but just keep that in mind."

"Maybe I will. Not now though, I don't have to go in that way."

"So, wanna go skiing some more?"

"Sure."

Sunset and Rainbow stood up, made their way up a hill, and began skiing down the slope in their wet snowpants, which, while very soggy on the inside, showed no wetness on the outside.

The End

Chapter 2: Sunset Loves Wetting Her Snowpants

Sunset Shimmer woke up to her alarm. At first, she didn't want to get out of bed. But then she remembered what she had planned for today, and immediately got up.

Leaving her black underwear from yesterday on, she removed her pajamas and put on her Backstage Pass outfit. She looked at her pajama pants and made a mental note to wear them under her snowpants the next time.

She walked into the kitchen and made a big pot of coffee, eating some toast for breakfast while it was heating up. Once the pot of coffee was done, she drank it, along with three cans of soda. She was already feeling a need to pee since she hadn't used the bathroom since getting out of bed, and had drank a hot chocolate and cider before bed, and this would make her need to pee even more.

Once she finished what she was drinking, she put on her winter outfit over top of her Backstage Pass outfit and walked outside. It was snowing, but the temperature was only mildly cold. Perfect for a winter walk.

As Sunset walked down the sidewalk, she slowly felt her need to pee get even more urgent. She hoped she would make it to where she was trying to get to, but she was confident that she would. She had really enjoyed her first snowpants wetting and wanted to do it again.

By the time she reached the park, she was twice as desperate as she was before. She was enjoying her desperation, and knew she would take even more pleasure in what was to come. She walked back and forth along the path, allowing her bladder to fill up even more.

When she leaked a little, she decided it was time to do what she came here for. She found a nice snowbank a bit away from the path, and sat down in it. If anyone saw her, it wouldn't look suspicious. She had been walking for the past half hour and so of course she would want to rest for a bit. She sat and fidgeted, letting her desperation continue for a short while.

After another leak, she giggled slightly, and then spread her legs and peed. She sighed of relief and pleasure as her stream soaked her pants and the inside of her snowpants, feeling her crotch and butt get absolutely soaked. Just like the last time, she could hear a hissing noise and see steam rising off her snowpants. She loved the sight of this, the only visible sign of what was going on under her winter outfit. Even more did she love the feel of it. The relief, the warm wetness, the naughty feeling of wetting herself...

After over a minute, she finished peeing and sighed of relief. She no longer needed to go, and her pants and snowpants were soaking wet. She felt like some of it was pooling around her bottom, but she knew it would be absorbed by her snowpants.

"Hiya, Sunset!"

Sunset nearly jumped and looked in the direction of the voice. Pinkie Pie was sitting in the snow close by. She hadn't even seen her come. She was a bit nervous, but reminded herself that her snowpants didn't show any wetness. "Uh... Hi, Pinkie. How are you doing?" She smiled, trying to act casual.

"Really great! How are you doing?"

"I'm doing good, too."

"Did you like wetting your snowpants?"

Sunset blushed beet red. "How...?"

"You think I can't tell when someone's peeing their snowpants? I do it all the time! Actually, I'm wet right now. And I see Rainbow Dash and Applejack peeing their snowpants a lot. They think I don't notice, but I can tell all the signs. Only when they're peeing though. After that, it's impossible to tell, so don't worry! Your wet snowpants are safe with me!"

Sunset sighed of relief. But she should have known. Rainbow Dash was pretty sure that Pinkie wet her snowpants, and they'd all seen Pinkie wet the bed and laugh it off. And so Applejack wet her snowpants too? That didn't surprise her. "So, you like wetting your snowpants too."

"Well, duh! It's the greatest feeling ever! Sometimes I drink a lot right before I go out and play in the snow so that I'm more likely to pee!"

"To tell you the truth, I came out here specifically to pee in my snowpants." Sunset blushed lightly, for Rainbow mainly wet her snowpants for convenience rather than planning a snowpants wetting. But she smiled.

Pinkie giggled. "I don't blame you. Sometimes I wonder if Dashie plans it too, she does it a lot."

"That wouldn't surprise me."

"Wanna go get some pancakes and hot chocolate?"

"Sure."

So Sunset and Pinkie stood up. Sunset felt a bit of pee dripping into her shoes, but not much, the rest had been absorbed by her snowpants, which were very wet on the inside but dry on the outside. As they walked, Sunset enjoyed the feeling of having wet pants while anyone who walked by them had absolutely no idea.

They walked to a restaurant where they ordered some pancakes and an extra large hot chocolate. No one in the restaurant even suspected how wet Sunset was underneath her winter outfit. Afterwards, they returned to the park, where, after having a snowball fight, they sat back down. After talking for a while...

"I have to go to the bathroom," said Sunset.

"Me too," said Pinkie.

Sssssssssssssss...

"Ahhhhhhh," sighed Sunset and Pinkie in unison.
