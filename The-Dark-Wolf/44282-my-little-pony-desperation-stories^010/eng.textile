Next chapter. The character in this one is a filly, but fimfiction allows it because they're not human or humanoid, and plus it's not outright sexual, just desperation. And I've seen multiple depictions of Sweetie Belle wetting herself too.

Another note: Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon are still mean to them here, so this is like an Alt. Universe where they either haven't gotten their cutie marks yet, or have through different means.

Apple Bloom's Desperation

"You might be able to hold it longer than Pinkie Pie, and MAYBE the other three, but not me! Most mares in the Apple Family have bladders of steel, and ah'm no exception!"

"Oh yeah? Then prove it! Let's have a competition tomorrow! We'll both drink lots of cider in the morning, and then hold it all day to see who can hold it longer!"

"Ah accept. And ah know ah'm gonna win!"

Applejack and Rainbow Dash spit on their hooves and did a hoof bump, while Apple Bloom watched from behind a tree.

Was it true that most mares in the Apple Family had a steel bladder? Was it something to be proud of? Did she herself have a steel bladder too?

...

The next day, Apple Bloom walked into the doorway where Rainbow Dash and Applejack were having dinner together, and it was obvious that both mares were in desperate need of a bathroom.

"Think you can make it?" said Rainbow Dash, fidgeting hard in her seat.

"Ah know ah can!" said Applejack.

"You two still need to go to the bathroom?" said Apple Bloom.

Applejack and Rainbow Dash turned in her direction, noticing her for the first time.

"Uh, yeah, but we can hold it!" said Applejack.

Apple Bloom said nothing and walked to her room. How long had Rainbow Dash and Applejack been holding it? How long could she hold? Maybe she'd have a steel bladder like her sister. There was only one way to know for sure.

...

The next day, Apple Bloom drank several glasses of apple juice at breakfast to see how long she could last. Applejack barely noticed how much her sister was drinking.

Then, Apple Bloom went to school, constantly checking the clock to see how long she was holding it for.

About an hour into the class, Apple Bloom felt the urge to pee, but was easily able to hold it. However, after the second hour, Apple Bloom was feeling more desperate, and did her best to hide it. However, she couldn't keep herself from fidgeting, and the other ponies noticed it.

Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo noticed it the most, but chose not to say anything for the moment.

At recess, Apple Bloom continued to hold. She could have used the bathroom of course, but she wanted to see how long she could hold it for. She was much more desperate than before, feeling intense pressure in her bladder and sweating quite a bit.

Diamond Tiara noticed how desperate Apple Bloom was, holding herself with one hoof. She didn't know that it was Apple Bloom's plan to hold it for as long as she could.

"Hey Silver Spoon," said Diamond Tiara. "Apple Bloom looks like she really needs to go!"

"Yeah, she does," said Silver Spoon.

"Let's make sure she doesn't use the bathroom all day, so she can wet herself and be humiliated in front of the entire class!"

"I have just the plan!"

Silver Spoon walked into the bathroom and stuffed the entire roll of toilet paper in it. This would clog it for sure.

...

The day continued, and Apple Bloom continued to hold it, becoming more desperate as time went on. She had never been this desperate before, and she couldn't believe how long she had held it. Maybe she did have a steel bladder. But, she wanted to see just how strong it was.

As the hours went by, Apple Bloom became more desperate, to the point that she thought she might lose control any minute now. But, she was able to hold it until the end of the class.

She walked to the Cutie Mark Crusaders clubhouse with Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle, still incredibly desperate but able to hold it in. Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon followed them from a distance to see how long it would take for Apple Bloom to be humiliated.

"She made it through the whole class," said Silver Spoon.

"She'll still wet herself in front of her friends," said Diamond Tiara. "It'll still be totally embarrassing!"

Apple Bloom sat with her legs crossed, fidgeting and sweating profusely.

"Apple Bloom, why haven't you used the bathroom all day?" said Sweetie Belle, noticing how desperate Apple Bloom was.

"Yeah, you look like you REALLY need to pee," said Scootaloo.

"Ah heard Applejack say most mares in the family have steel bladders, and ah want to prove that ah have one too."

Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo were worried that it might not end well for Apple Bloom, but decided to let her do what she wanted. If she wet herself, it was her fault, and they wouldn't make fun of her for it.

Apple Bloom's desperation got much worse as the hours went by. She crossed her legs tighter and squirmed harder, feeling the pee sloshing inside her. Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon watched her suffering from a distance.

After a few more hours, Apple Bloom was still holding it in but was much more desperate beyond what she had ever known.

"You know," she said through gritted teeth, "ah think I've proven how long ah can hold it for. Wait for a minute while ah use the bathroom."

Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo looked a little relieved as Apple Bloom burst out of the clubhouse.

But, Diamond Tiara had overheard their conversation, and clogged the closest bathroom already. She hid behind a corner as Apple Bloom ran into the bathroom, and groaned loudly when she saw it clogged with too much toilet paper. She tried flushing it just to be sure, but it overflowed.

She returned to the clubhouse even more desperate.

"Are you feeling better?" said Sweetie Belle tentatively, knowing that this was not the case.

"I'll be all right, I only have to hold it a bit longer."

As they did several fun activities, Apple Bloom got more desperate each time. She didn't know she could hold it this long. She eventually decided to run to the next closest bathroom, but Diamond Tiara sent Silver Spoon to occupy it before she got there, watching Apple Bloom's frustrated reaction. Apple Boom frantically danced in front of the outhouse for three minutes before she ran back to the clubhouse.

Throughout the day, Apple Bloom became even more desperate, and she ran to the third nearest bathroom, but Diamond Tiara had already slipped an "Out of order" sign on it. She ran to the second one again, but Silver Spoon was back inside it. She checked the first one again, but it was still clogged.

At sunset, Apple Bloom felt like she was about to burst. She was soaked in sweat, crossing her legs tight, and fidgeting harder than before.

"You should really go to the bathroom," said Sweetie Belle.

"It doesn't seem like you can hold it any longer," said Scootaloo.

"Ah know, but all the bathrooms are mysteriously out of my reach!"

"You could run to Sweet Apple Acres," said Sweetie Belle.

"Thanks, I'll do that!"

Apple Bloom ran to Sweet Apple Acres as fast as she could, afraid that she might lose it at any second.

She finally reached the bathroom door, but it was locked.

She knocked on the door. "Can you hurry it up? Ah need to go to the bathroom really badly!"

"Eyyyup," came Big Mac's voice.

She frantically danced for what felt like hours, before the toilet flushed, and Big Mac walked outside. Apple Bloom immediately ran into the bathroom, sat on the toilet, and began peeing.

...

Apple Bloom returned to the clubhouse, feeling more relieved than she had ever been. Not only that, but she was also excited that she was able to hold her pee for almost an entire day.

Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle could tell Apple Bloom had found her much-needed relief, but Sweetie Belle asked her if she was feeling better anyway.

"Much better! And ah held it for almost a whole day! It looks like ah really do have a steel bladder like my sister!"

Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo didn't really understand why it was so important to her, but they celebrated with her anyway.

"You mean it was her plan all along to hold her pee all day?" said Diamond Tiara, outraged.

"And we helped her achieve her goal," said Silver Spoon.

Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon walked away in a fit of rage.

Now for an Equestria Girls one.

Sunset Shimmer's Desperation

Sunset Shimmer woke up one morning. Her alarm hadn't gone off, and when she looked at the clock, she noticed that it was 7:45. She had overslept. She rushed out of her bed, changed out of her pajamas into a white and pink shirt and a pair of jeans, and ate her breakfast, which included drinking some water, milk, tea, coffee, and juice.

Once she was finished breakfast, she ran outside to take the bus to school. Fortunately, she got there just as the bus arrived. So, she got on the bus on time.

The bus had just started moving, and Sunset had just breathed a sigh of relief, when she realized she needed to pee. She remembered now that she didn't take her morning pee because she was in such a rush. Not only had she drank a lot this morning, but she had also drank several cups of coffee to stay awake last night, because she had been studying until midnight for a test. All of that liquid made her need to go more, but she knew she could hold it until she arrived at school.

However, the bus arrived at school right when her first class was about to begin, so she couldn't use the bathroom before class. Worse, her first class was math, and the math teacher wouldn't allow anyone to go to the bathroom during class, especially not at the beginning of the day. So she knew she'd have to hold it for the entire hour of math class.

Sunset tried to hide her desperation. She didn't even think of asking the teacher, for she knew what the answer would be, and it would just reveal her situation to the class. She was pretty good at hiding her need to pee, at least for a while. She tried hard not to fidget, and to focus on the math lessons, and the worksheets that came with them, which was hard for her because her desperation had increased by then.

After an uncomfortable hour, math class was over. Sunset was relieved to go to her geography class, for the teacher there would let students use the bathroom. Once she had taken her seat and the class was about to begin, Sunset raised her hand.

"Yes, Sunset Shimmer?"

"Can I go to the bathroom? I have to go really bad." She blushed a little.

"You may."

Despite her need to pee, Sunset felt better as she stood up. She tried not to look desperate as she walked toward the door, but as soon as she was out of the classroom, she ran as fast as she could toward the girl's bathroom, holding herself with one hand. She wasn't sure she was going to make it.

She reached the bathroom, but to her horror, she saw the dreaded "Out of order" sign on it. She could not believe it. She had been so close to getting relief, and it was once again denied. She knew this would mean she would have to hold it until the end of the day. She wasn't sure if she'd be able to do that, already she needed to pee really badly, but she'd try anyway.

She returned to the classroom, still in desperate need of a bathroom, and sat down. As the geography lesson went on, Sunset felt the need to pee become greater. Surely what she had drank with breakfast was catching up with her. She fidgeted and slightly crossed her legs. But she tried to stay calm, wanting to hide her desperation. A couple of students noticed her movements, but didn't say anything.

After geography class was recess. Sunset knew she was still several hours away from relief, and tried to stay calm while holding it as much as she could. As she met up with the other girls, Sunset was unable to keep herself from fidgeting more.

Applejack noticed first. "Are you all right, sugarcube?"

"It's nothing," said Sunset, trying to stay calm but sweating a little.

"It doesn't look like nothin' to me." Applejack knew perfectly well what Sunset's movements meant. "You gotta go to the bathroom real bad, don't you?"

"Yes," Sunset admitted. "I have to pee REALLY badly, but I'll be fine."

"Why in Canterlot High haven't you gone to the bathroom yet?"

"The girl's bathroom is out of order."

"Then it's only a matter of time before more girls are desperate too."

"You don't know how much I've had to drink, nor how long I've been holding it." Sunset grimaced and fidgeted a bit more. The pressure in her bladder was growing stronger every minute.

"Oh. Well, ah hope you can hold it till school's out."

...

Sunset became more desperate as the day went on, and had a harder time hiding it. By noon, Sunset had been holding her pee for four hours. As she sat at the cafeteria table for lunch, she fidgeted harder and crossed her legs more than before. She could not believe she had held it this long, nor did she think she'd be able to hold it for much longer.

She tried to hide how desperate she was, but most of her friends noticed it by now.

"Are you all right, Sunset?" said Fluttershy nervously, for she was very worried about her.

"The girl's bathroom is out of order, so she's real desperate to pee," said Applejack.

"I myself am in need of relief," said Rarity, who was also crossing her legs tightly under the table.

"Try not to think about it," said Rainbow Dash. "Think about waterfalls! Big waterfalls flowing down into a lake! Fountains, with water pouring out endlessly! Rain falling, drops of water, splashing in puddles..."

Sunset moaned as she felt her bladder quiver, and crossed her legs even tighter. Rarity let out a whimper, and Sunset could tell she was feeling the same way.

"Rainbow, quit it!" said Applejack. "That's not funny."

Sunset ate her lunch and reluctantly had a glass of water to drink, and after lunch was science class. Sunset found it really hard to concentrate on the class; all of her attention was on her extremely full bladder, and trying her hardest to hold it. She was fidgeting more than ever now, and crossing and uncrossing her legs over and over again. She was more desperate than ever now, and it showed in her face. Many students noticed her, and were looking at her. Sunset blushed with embarrassment at this, but knew she had to do anything she could to hold her full bladder. If she wet herself in front of the class, it would just be even more humiliating, and she wanted to avoid that at all cost.

A few seats away, Rarity was fidgeting and crossing her legs as well. Sunset knew Rarity couldn't possibly be holding nearly as much as her, but she was still struggling to remain calm.

Though she got more desperate as time went on, she made it to the end of science class. Next was the final class of the day: English class. This was usually an easy class for Sunset, but this time, she was bursting to pee, and couldn't hide it anymore. As she fidgeted, more desperate than she was ten minutes ago, she noticed that Pinkie Pie was fidgeting a lot too, and crossing and uncrossing her legs. She was definitely desperate to pee too.

"I shouldn't have drank all that chocolate milk at noon," Pinkie muttered to herself.

Seeing how Rarity and Pinkie Pie were very desperate to pee only made Sunset's need greater. She was barely able to focus on the class, and crossed her legs tight, feeling as though she might burst at any moment. The teacher, naturally, noticed Sunset's desperation, but by now knew that the girl's bathroom was out of order so she said nothing.

After what felt like forever, the bell rang for the end of school. As soon as it did, Sunset stood up and rushed to the bus faster than Rainbow Dash could without her geode. She was dying to pee at this point. As she waited for the bus, she did the pee dance. She didn't care who was watching her, she just wanted to get home to get her much-needed relief. After a few minutes, which felt like an hour, the bus finally arrived, and she got onto the bus as fast as she could and took one of the seats near the front.

She crossed her legs and fidgeted as the rest of the students boarded the bus. Finally, it started to move. All Sunset had to do was hold it for the rest of the bus trip and she could finally get to her bathroom.

However, the bus ran into a great traffic jam. The bus barely even moved over the course of ten minutes. Sunset couldn't believe it. Did the world not want her to relieve herself? Was there an accident ahead? There would be an accident inside the bus soon if traffic didn't get moving!

She was sure she was seconds away from wetting her pants. But, after an hour, the bus finally got moving again, and stopped at Sunset's house. It was 5:00 PM. She had been holding it for nine hours. Sunset rushed into her house as fast as she could, and rushed into her bathroom. She fumbled with her zipper a bit but got it down, pulled down her pants and panties, sat on the toilet, and began peeing. The relief felt absolutely wonderful after holding it for so long.

Back to ponies!

Trixie's Desperation

After Starlight Glimmer, Trixie, Discord, and Thorax saved Equestria from Chrysalis, the four of them started hanging out more often, much like when the Main 6 saved Equestria from Nightmare Moon.

Although Trixie, Discord, and Thorax were good friends with Starlight, Trixie and Discord still haven't been able to get along with each other as well as they did with Thorax. Discord would sometimes mention how most of Trixie's magic tricks weren't actually magic, and Trixie would sometimes call him "klutzy draconequus", as a reference to their adventure.

One day, Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie planned to prank Twilight by putting butter on the floor so she would slip. As they walked away to call Twilight, Discord walked in, with Starlight, Trixie, and Thorax behind him.

As Discord stepped into the room, he slipped on the butter and fell down.

"Klutzy draconequus," said Trixie, and she laughed at how funny he look when he fell.

Starlight tried hard not to laugh. "Are you all right, Discord?"

Discord touched the floor, realizing it was covered in butter. Someone put it there as a prank, and he suspected Trixie. She must have done it so she'd have an excuse to call him "klutzy draconequus" again, because she really loved calling him that, and it annoyed him.

"I'm fine. But, there's something important I forgot to do. See you!" He teleported away.

...

Discord paced around in his house, planning his revenge on Trixie. He decided to give her a taste of her own medicine. And what better way to do so than to do to her the same thing he had done to Twilight several days ago? He started planning everything out.

...

When Trixie woke up the next morning, she drank her morning coffee, as she always did.

What she didn't know was that Discord had done two things while she was asleep. First, he changed her alarm clock so she'd wake up an hour later than usual. And second, he had added something to her instant coffee: A special herb he found at Zecora's place, which had strong diuretic effects. Any pony who drank anything with that herb would have to pee very badly very soon.

After Trixie finished drinking her coffee, she looked at the clock.

"Oh no! Is it that time already? I'm late!"

She had several activities to do, so she rushed outside without taking her morning pee.

Discord watched from his hiding place, excited to see what would happen. This would be even more fun than when he did it to Twilight.

First, Trixie was putting on a magic show in Ponyville. Right when the show began, the herb was already starting to take effect, and Trixie needed to pee. She held it throughout the entire show, and then when she was done, she raced to the nearest outhouse.

To her dismay, there was an Out of Order sign on it.

She had another magic show in Baltimare soon, and she wasn't sure she'd have time to find another bathroom that was working.

As soon as she ran, Discord snapped his fingers, and the Out of Order sign on the outhouse disappeared.

As Trixie made her way to Baltimare, she could feel her need to pee increase every minute. It was especially hard to hold it when she was pulling her wagon.

Discord followed, keeping out of Trixie's sight.

She arrived at Baltimare a few minutes early. She found a bathroom, but to her dismay there was a big lineup in front of it. She didn't have time to wait, so she ran to the spot where her magic show was taking place.

The ponies vanished as soon as Trixie was out of sight, for they were an illusion created by Discord.

After a very uncomfortable magic show, during which Trixie almost messed up one of her tricks, she returned to the bathroom. There was no line, but as she entered the bathroom, she saw the toilet was clogged and overflowing, so she ran back out.

Next, Trixie needed to pick up some props for her tricks at a shop that was only in the Crystal Empire. She left her wagon in the forest near Baltimare in order to board the train and take it to the Crystal Empire.

As soon as she boarded the train, she darted to the bathroom, but it was out of order as well.

Discord continued to watch Trixie from the windows, not letting her see him, and removing the Out of Order sign whenever Trixie wasn't near the bathroom door.

Trixie sat with her legs crossed, fidgeting for the entire train ride.

Upon arrival, she searched the entire Crystal Empire for a bathroom, but they were all lined up or else had Out of Order tags.

Why doesn't anyone else look as desperate as I am? thought Trixie.

She gave up and bought her props, then got back on board the train back to Baltimare to pick up her wagon. She checked the bathroom again, but it was still out of order. (Or so it seemed) So she fidgeted the entire ride, feeling more desperate by the minute.

It was almost noon, and Trixie and Starlight were having lunch at a restaurant today. So once she got back to her wagon, she ran to Ponyville as fast as she could. She ran to the nearest bathroom, but it was out of order again.

She ran into the restaurant where Starlight was sitting at a table. Trixie sat down next to her, crossing her legs.

After they ordered their food, Starlight noticed Trixie fidgeting, crossing her legs, and very desperate.

"Are you all right?" said Starlight.

"I'm fine," said Trixie, though she really wasn't.

"Well, I'll stay with you the rest of the day just in case you do need help with anything."

...

Once they finished lunch, Trixie had another magic show to put on in the changeling kingdom. She ran there as fast as she could.

"I've never seen you run this fast," said Starlight.

"I just can't wait until the changelings see my magic show," said Trixie.

She's not even saying "The Great and Powerful Trixie", thought Starlight.

Trixie's desperation made her run faster and faster, so sometimes Starlight had to teleport to keep up.

When they reached the changeling kingdom, Trixie said "There's something I have to do real quick. It won't take long."

She ran to the nearest bathroom, but there wasn't a toilet inside.

The toilet reappeared as soon as the bathroom was out of Trixie's sight.

Trixie did her magic show, but she messed up some of her tricks because of her desperation. She was able to pull a few tricks off while holding it, and was able to hold it the entire show. Enough that the changelings weren't unimpressed.

Next she had to do some work at the rock farm, which was a little farther from the changeling kingdom than Baltimare was from Ponyville.

She ran there as fast as she could, feeling the pressure in her bladder increase by the minute, and Starlight keeping up with her.

As usual, upon arrival she checked the outhouses, but they were all out of order.

So, she harvested the rocks, with great difficulty. She wasn't sure how much longer she could hold it.

Next was dinner at Starlight's village, so she could get to know the ponies there better. Unfortunately, Starlight's village was on the opposite side of Equestria as the rock farm. Leaving her wagon behind, Trixie ran to the nearest train station, in Appleoosa.

"Are you sure you're all right?" said Starlight.

"I told you I'm fine!" said Trixie a little more harshly than she meant, for she really needed to go.

Upon the train, Trixie checked the bathroom, but it was still out of order.

She sat with her legs crossed, fidgeting harder. It was obvious she needed to go, but Starlight didn't say anything this time. She felt bad about snapping at Starlight, but she couldn't help it.

It was a long and very uncomfortable train ride, and she thought she wasn't going to make it, but she did.

Upon arrival, she said "I gotta comb my mane," and ran. She found an outhouse and ran into it. Finally, it was open, and the toilet was there, and it wasn't clogged. She was finally going to get relief!

She was about to turn around to sit on the toilet, when it disappeared.

"Are you KIDDING ME!?"

She fidgeted for the entire dinner with Double Diamond, Party Favor, and Sugar Belle. She could barely focus on anything they said, the pressure in her bladder was too intense.

She held it in the entire dinner, and then she was set to watch one of Rainbow Dash's Wonderbolt shows in Canterlot. She told Rainbow Dash she'd see it and Rainbow Dash would be disappointed if she didn't show.

Canterlot wasn't very far from Starlight's village, but Trixie was more desperate than ever. Once again she checked the bathroom, but it was occupied. As soon as Trixie was away, Discord unlocked the door. He was going to re-lock it if he needed to, but Trixie still didn't want Starlight to know how badly she needed to go and might suspect if she tried again.

Once at the Canterlot stadium, Trixie separated from Starlight, saying she was going to get some drinks, but really looking for a bathroom. She found all the stalls full (though three of them were "occupied" by Discord's illusions).

Because she told Starlight she was going for drinks, she knew she'd get suspicious without them, so she stood in line for five minutes to get two cups of soda. She would have only got one for Starlight, but she thought Starlight would suspect if she didn't get one for herself.

She regretted drinking the soda immediately, for it seemed to increase her need to pee even more.

She fidgeted harder with her legs crossed even tighter during Rainbow Dash's show. She barely focused on any of it, focusing instead on her very full bladder. Starlight seemed more focused on the show than Trixie.

After what seemed like hours, the show finally ended, and Trixie and Starlight took the train back to Ponyville. Trixie found the train bathroom empty this time, but the toilet disappeared seconds after she entered.

She suspected she knew who was behind this, but right now she was worried about not having an accident in front of Starlight.

It was sunset when they reached Ponyville. Trixie was about to burst.

"Trixie, I can't keep this up any longer," said Starlight.

"What do you mean?"

"I knew you were holding your pee all along."

Trixie blushed. "How did you know?"

"It was kind of obvious, with you fidgeting, crossing your legs, holding yourself, and suddenly running off every time we reached a new destination."

"I need your help!" Trixie said, tearing up with the effort of holding it in. "I needed to pee all day, but I haven't been able to find a single bathroom I can use! They're all out of order, or have lines, or have vanishing toilets."

"Vanishing toilets? That's weird... I'll help you find one."

Starlight teleported Trixie to every bathroom in Ponyville, starting with the bathrooms in Twilight's castle, but each of them had a line or an out of order sign, except for a few. If regular bathrooms, the stalls would be full. If outhouses, the toilets would be gone.

They reached the last bathroom in Ponyville, an outhouse. It had no line or sign.

Trixie was about to run into it, when Discord walked in with a newspaper and closed the door.

Trixie was even closer to bursting, holding herself and doing the pee dance, feeling waves of pee sloshing inside her.

Starlight knocked on the door. "Don't take too long in there. Trixie really needs to go."

Discord could sense Trixie's desperation, and he deliberately waited until she was literally seconds away from wetting herself. Then he opened the door and walked out.

Trixie ran into the bathroom faster than Rainbow Dash and closed the door shut tight.

"Discord, can you come with me for a second?" said Starlight. She led him a bit away from the outhouse.

"Trixie said every single bathroom she tried was mysteriously out of order, lined up, or had vanishing toilets. I don't know a lot of magic users besides myself who can make things disappear like that."

"Yes, it was me! This was all a revenge prank on Trixie!"

"Revenge for what?"

"For the butter prank she pulled on me."

"Making her wet herself is a little more extreme than slipping on butter," said Starlight.

"First, I didn't make her wet herself. I specifically waited till the last second and then let her use the bathroom. Second, it wasn't so much tripping me as the fact that she did it as an excuse to call me 'klutzy draconequus' again. That's really annoying."

Trixie emerged from the bathroom, feeling immensely relieved, and completely dry. She had never known relief like what she felt about a minute earlier.

"Trixie, did you make Discord slip on butter to call him 'klutzy draconequus' again?"

"I'm thinking about doing it in the future, because I suspect you were behind those vanishing toilets. But, the Great and Powerful Trixie did no such thing!"

"Oh, wait! This morning Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie said they were going to prank Twilight. I think they put the butter on the floor."

"Oh. I thought it was Trixie because she likes to call me 'klutzy draconequus'."

"I do that because you sometimes get really annoying, because you always mention how my magic tricks are only an illusion, and sometimes I get a bit jealous of your magic," said Trixie. "You can make things appear, transform things, and do so much more, while I can only make a teacup with my magic."

"I had no idea."

"Now, apologize to each other," said Starlight.

"I'm sorry for calling you 'klutzy draconequus' all the time," said Trixie.

"And I'm sorry for blaming you for the prank," said Discord. "Oh, and for making you need to pee for the whole day."

And from that point forward, Discord and Trixie got along a bit better.

*016*2018-06-06 05:49

Here's another one. (I wrote these all a while back. There's only two more after this, and they take place at the same time with characters I don't usually do, but I was requested to.)

Starlight's Desperation

Starlight Glimmer was planning to visit Sunburst at the Crystal Empire today. Spike and Trixie were going with her. Twilight would have liked to go as well, but she was going to have Ember come to her castle for a meeting today.

At about 8:00 AM, Starlight, Trixie, and Spike were at the train station.

Starlight started to feel the need to pee, for she had drank a few glasses of water last night and hadn't taken her morning pee today.

"I'll be right back," she said to Trixie and Spike as she made her way to the bathroom, knowing there was a half hour before the train arrived.

However, when she got there she found a long line of mares waiting for the bathroom. Some of them looked desperate. Starlight stayed in line, hoping she would eventually get her turn.

Come on! How long are they taking in there anyway? I should be much farther along by now!

However, after half an hour of waiting, during which there were still some ponies in front of her, the train came to the station.

Well, that's all right, I can just use the train's bathroom.

So, Starlight rejoined Trixie and Spike and they boarded the train.

Once the train started moving, Starlight said to Trixie and Spike "I'll be back in a minute, I just have to go to the bathroom."

She got out of her seat and ran toward the bathroom. Unfortunately, it was out of order, so she returned to her seat, still needing to pee. It wasn't too bad, she wasn't desperate yet, but she was getting very uncomfortable.

"That was fast," said Spike.

"The bathroom is out of order," said Starlight.

"Will you be all right?" said Trixie.

"Don't worry, I can hold it until we get to the Crystal Empire." At least, she hoped she could.

...

Two hours later, Starlight was fidgeting and slightly crossing her legs. Her need to pee had gotten greater since she found the bathroom out of order. Outside it was snowing hard.

Finally, the train stopped. Starlight stood up to find the first bathroom at the Crystal Empire so she could finally find relief.

However, she had barely taken a few steps when she heard a pony's voice make a terrible announcement.

"Attention passengers. The train has stopped because there's so much snow obstructing the way from the snowstorm. Everyone must stay in the train, because the weather outside is dangerous."

Now Starlight started to worry, because this meant she'd have to hold her pee for even longer, and she really needed to go!

"Oh no... This is not good."

...

Two more hours later, it was noon. Starlight was still fidgeting, needing to pee more than ever.

"How much longer until we get moving again?" she said.

"Here," said Spike, giving Starlight and Trixie some snacks. "I packed these just in case."

As they were eating their snacks, Trixie said "I can't believe this is happening to Trixie again!"

"What exactly is happening to you again?" said Starlight, crossing her legs.

"The Great and Powerful Trixie is starting to need a bathroom as well, and it seems I'll have to hold it again."

"I have to pee too. I've been needing to pee since we were at the train station."

"Why did this have to happen when the bathroom was out of order? It couldn't have picked a worse time!"

Starlight didn't want to take the drinks that came with the snacks, but she was feeling thirsty, so she reluctantly drank them. In half an hour the pressure in her bladder grew.

At 3:00 PM, the train still hadn't moved, and Starlight was getting more desperate to pee. It didn't help that it was cold. Trixie was also fidgeting and crossing her legs, looking almost as desperate as her. The sight of her friend's desperation only made Starlight more desperate herself. As desperate as Trixie looked, Starlight had been holding her pee for four hours longer, and she wasn't sure she could hold it.

"How are you holding up?" said Starlight.

"Really uncomfortable," said Trixie.

"Me too."

Then the pony made another announcement.

"Attention passengers. The train is snowbound, but help is on the way."

"Couldn't someone at least fix the bathroom?" said Trixie. "The Great and Powerful Trixie needs to pee!"

Starlight noticed that she and Trixie were not the only mares on the train desperate to pee. Lyra was fidgeting a lot, and turned toward Bon Bon.

"She's not the only one. I need to pee really badly!"

Minuette was crossing her legs very tightly, with a pained expression. "I don't know if I can hold it..."

Roseluck was squirming in her seat with her legs crossed as well. "I really need to go!"

Seeing more desperate ponies only made Starlight more desperate.

It had the same effect on Trixie too. "Hurry up!" she said, fidgeting more.

At 5:00 PM, the snowstorm had stopped, but Starlight felt she was about to burst. She had been holding it for 9 hours, longer than she thought she could ever hold it, and she knew she wouldn't be able to hold it much longer.

Fortunately, help finally arrived.

Twilight, Ember, and a couple of other dragons flew over to the train, and the dragons melted the snow with their fire breath.

"It's about time!" said Trixie, and Starlight felt the same way.

Once the snow was melted, Twilight said "Starlight? Trixie? Spike?"

Starlight, Trixie, and Spike ran out of the train, and Spike gave Twilight a hug. "I'm so happy to see you!"

"Ember and I heard about what happened to the train. So, Ember called a couple of dragons to help us get the train moving again."

"You don't know how much I appreciate that," said Starlight.

"We also brought some hot chocolate to warm you up. It must have been pretty cold."

Starlight knew she'd regret drinking more liquid, but she was very cold as Twilight had said, and had to warm up. So, she, Trixie, and Spike drank their hot chocolate, feeling much warmer afterwards.

"We can give you a ride to the Crystal Empire," said Ember.

"That would be wonderful," said Starlight.

"Just fly as fast as you can," said Trixie.

One dragon each gave Starlight and Trixie a ride, while Ember took Spike, and they flew to the Crystal Empire, Twilight flying beside them.

It wasn't long before the hot chocolate had gone through Starlight, increasing her need to pee, which she didn't even think was possible.

Soon, they landed at the Crystal Empire.

"Thank you so much for your help," said Starlight to Twilight and the dragons.

"Yes, I don't know how much longer I'd have been able to hold it," said Trixie.

"Thanks for the ride," Spike said to Ember.

As Twilight, Ember, and the other dragons flew away, Starlight, Trixie, and Spike made their way to Sunburst's house. By now it was sunset, and Starlight was more desperate to pee than she'd ever been before. Trixie was not as desperate as Starlight, but still extremely desperate.

Halfway there they ran into Sunburst.

"Starlight! I was so worried about you when I heard what had happened to the train. I'm glad you're all right."

Starlight barely heard what he said. She was looking around for a bathroom, but any bathrooms in sight either had an "out of order" sign or a long line. It's as if someone wanted her to wet herself (even though she wasn't wearing anything).

"You must be hungry," said Sunburst. "Come with me to a restaurant that opened a few weeks ago."

As Sunburst led them to the restaurant, Starlight and Trixie hoped they'd be able to use the bathroom there. They really needed to go. Starlight could feel waves of pee sloshing inside her. So did Trixie.

As soon as they reached the restaurant, Trixie ran into the bathroom, which was a single bathroom with one toilet.

"Trixie!" said Starlight. "You knew I'd been holding it longer than you!"

The only table available was one that was next to the bathroom, and from there, Starlight heard Trixie sigh in relief. This only increased her need to pee. She hoped Trixie would hurry. She couldn't hold it much longer.

When Trixie came out, Starlight almost felt better knowing she'd get her relief soon. Until she saw that Trixie looked embarrassed.

"What happened?" said Starlight.

"I'm so sorry, but the Great and Powerful Trixie accidentally clogged the toilet."

"WHAT?"

"I'm so sorry Starlight. I know you've been needing to pee much longer than I have, and I should have let you go first, but I couldn't help it. The desperation got the best of me."

Starlight smiled and said "Don't worry about it." But in the privacy of her mind, she was furious. She had been so close to relief, and it had been taken from her. How come I'd been holding my pee so much longer than Trixie, but she was the one who got to pee? As annoyed and desperate as she was, she had no choice but to try to hold it until after dinner.

While they ate dinner together, Starlight was squirming harder than ever, crossing her legs tightly under the table, fidgeting a lot and doing everything she could to avoid wetting herself. The glass of water she drank didn't help either.

Once dinner was over, Sunburst said "It's getting late. You could stay at my house for the night. It gets lonely when I'm there all alone."

So, Sunburst, Starlight, Trixie, and Spike went to Sunburst's house. Starlight was really about to burst this time, doing the pee dance and crossing her legs on the way to Sunburst's house.

By the time they got there, it was 8:00 PM. Starlight had been holding her pee for 12 hours already.

As soon as Sunburst opened the front door to his house, Starlight quickly said "Where's the bathroom?"

"That door over there," Sunburst pointed to a door with his hoof.

Starlight ran into the bathroom faster than Rainbow Dash. Once she was inside and closed the door, she sat on the toilet and finally started to pee. It felt so wonderful to finally let go after holding it all day.

After a long and relieving pee, Starlight came out, feeling much better, but noticed Spike chuckling a bit.

"What happened?" said Starlight.

"We could hear you sighing in relief from outside."

Starlight blushed.

"Don't worry about it," said Sunburst. "Spike told me how you'd been desperate to pee all day. I can only imagine how it must have felt being that desperate, or finally getting relief. But now, let's forget about that and have some fun."

Starlight was thankful for the change in subject. They spent the night playing games and telling stories.

*018*2018-06-07 02:32

Last chapter is in two parts taking place side by side. I'll put them in the same post.

Octavia's Desperation

At sunset, Octavia was getting ready for an important and elegant event in Canterlot tonight, and she was going to play music during the event.

Vinyl Scratch was busy, because she was getting ready for an event of her own.

As soon as Octavia was ready, she got her cello in its case and made her way to the train station, rushing a bit to get there on time. As soon as she arrived, she realized that, in her hurry to get there, she had forgotten to pee. And she hadn't done so in hours.

The train wasn't going to come for another half hour, so Octavia decided to use the train station bathroom.

Unfortunately, much like what had happened with Starlight, there was a big line for the little filly's room. Some of the mares looked desperate, though Octavia wasn't quite there yet.

The line progressed slowly, and Octavia wished the ponies in front of her would hurry up. Why were they all taking so long?

There were only two ponies in front of her before the train arrived. Octavia didn't want to miss the train, so she left the line and boarded the train, counting on using the train's bathroom.

The train bathroom hadn't been out of order since Starlight's trip to the Crystal Empire, but, unfortunately for Octavia, it was now. She suspected there was some prankster who was trying to get ponies to wet themselves. Or perhaps someone clogged the toilet too much.

Octavia found a seat and sat down, deciding to hold it until she reached Canterlot.

The train ride didn't take long, but it felt like hours, as Octavia felt her need to pee grow greater with every minute, as her bladder became even more full. She fidgeted slightly while crossing her legs. But if she could just hold it for a bit longer, she could use the nearest bathroom at Canterlot before the event.

Unfortunately for her, the train suddenly stopped.

"Attention passengers!" said a pony on the speakers. "There is a tree trunk in the middle of the railway. We will remove it as fast as we can and then get moving again."

Octavia said nothing, but fidgeted more, hoping they would hurry.

After ten minutes, the train started moving again. Octavia was startled a bit, feeling a jolt in her bladder, but managed to hold it in and was grateful they would be at Canterlot soon.

The train arrived at the Canterlot station a few minutes late. Octavia looked at the time and realized she would have to hurry to the event.

As she raced to the event, she became more desperate. She had only been holding it for an hour but she had a lot to drink several hours before that.

She arrived at the event just in time, at 8:00 PM, and didn't even have time to pee at the bathroom here. She had to take her cello out of its case immediately and begin playing.

While she was playing her first song, she did her best to hold it in. There would be a break before the next song, so if she could just hold it until the song was over, she could find a bathroom.

She hid her desperation, for she didn't want the elegant ponies of Canterlot to see her squirming and fidgeting.

She nearly missed a note in one of the songs, her full bladder nearly distracting her, but she managed to play her song exactly right, though slightly faster than normal.

The song only lasted three minutes, but it felt like three hours to Octavia. Once she was done, she raced to the bathroom.

To her dismay, there was a line for the bathroom. She tried waiting her turn, and the line progressed slightly faster than the line at the train station had.

"Oooh!" said Twinkleshine, who was right in front of her. "Hurry up! I really gotta go!"

"So do I," said Octavia quietly, though she wasn't sure Twinkleshine could hear her. She stood still, hiding how much she needed to pee.

Just as Twinkleshine ran into the bathroom, it was time for Octavia to play her next song. She sighed and returned to her position with her cello and began playing her second song.

This time she would be playing three more songs in a row, each one five minutes long. Octavia was not sure she would be up to this task. She played as best as she could, nearly speeding up the first song, but painfully playing it as slow as it was supposed to be. All the while holding in her pee and hiding her desperation.

The equally graceful Rarity was at this event as well and she really didn't want to see her, one of the most popular ponies who not only ran a successful boutique, but also saved Equestria a few times, to see her desperate. Of course, she didn't know that Rarity had once been in a situation like this herself. Besides, Rarity really enjoyed her songs.

Her desperation grew with each song she played, but miraculously she was able to hold it while not messing up the songs.

By the time she finished the third song, it was 8:30 PM. There would be a half-hour break between this and her next song, which she was sure would be enough time to find the relief she needed.

On her way to the bathroom, Rarity walked up to her.

"Octavia, I have to say, your songs are absolutely lovely. The first one seemed a bit fast, but you always play so gracefully."

"Why, thank you," said Octavia, trying not to cross her legs or do the pee dance, and sweating a little.

"Is everything quite all right, darling?"

"It's... just fine..."

"I look forward to your next song in half an hour."

This next song would be half an hour long. She really wanted to get her relief before this song. But, she had half an hour to do it.

She nearly lost it right there when she saw more ponies in line, many of whom were doing the pee dance because they had drank a lot of punch.

Upper Crust cut in front of her, looking snobbish and trying to hide her desperation, but crossing her legs slightly. Octavia couldn't help but do the same. It was no good pretending she wasn't waiting for the bathroom, but she still didn't want anyone to see her squirm.

The ponies each took about five minutes in the bathroom. They probably peed for two minutes and spend the other three making sure their hooves were spotlessly clean.

Just as Upper Crust entered the bathroom, Octavia looked at the time. It was 9:00 PM. Octavia sighed and returned to play her song.

This time she was near the middle of the room. Here, she realized uncomfortably for the first time, was an elegant fountain. The water running made her need to pee even more. She really needed to go, so she crossed her legs while playing her next song. This seemed to help, but she was afraid she'd lose it if she uncrossed them.

Octavia played her best, though she played one note wrong, but quickly recovered and tried to play as gracefully as she could, without speeding up the song. It was difficult with her desperation combined with the sounds of the fountain.

After what felt like an eternity, she finished the song at 9:30. There was a ten-minute break before the next song, and she started to run to the bathroom, but bumped into a stallion and fell down.

"I'm terribly sorry," she said, getting the pony to his feet while ignoring the throbbing in her bladder, and ran towards the bathroom, stopping whenever a pony crossed her path.

"Would you care for a drink?" said Fancy Pants, holding up a goblet of punch.

Octavia knew this would only make things worse, but she hadn't drank anything in hours and was pretty thirsty. So, reluctantly, she drank a goblet of punch. Noticing how fast she drank it, Fancy Pants offered her another, and she downed it too.

"I must say, your songs are quite marvelous," he said.

"I'm glad you like them," said Octavia, trying to hide her desperation.

"I'm looking forward to your next two songs."

Her next two songs were both around half an hour long, and back to back. She was really good at this, and this wouldn't be a challenge if she didn't have to pee so badly. But if she did, it would be really hard for her. She hoped she would find her relief this time.

"Will you excuse me for a bit? There's something I need to do."

From how nervous she looked, Fancy Pants was able to guess what was up, but didn't say more than "As you wish."

Octavia ran to the bathroom. There was only one mare waiting for her this time, Lyrica Lilac, who, for some reason, had some chocolate cake frosting on her mane. Octavia groaned. Lyrica was going to spend a long time washing her mane.

After two minutes, the pony inside the bathroom came out, and Lyrica entered. Octavia waited impatiently for her to come out.

Until, it was 9:40. Octavia let out a quiet groan and returned to the fountain, playing her next two songs. She played the first one a little fast, unable to ignore how much she needed to pee, or the sound of running water. Seeing the audience looking a little weirdly at her when she was done the first song, she started playing the second song as the regular speed. As she played, her desperation increased, and she wasn't sure how much longer she could hold it.

She finally finished at 10:30, and there was another half-hour break before her next songs. They were about five to ten minutes long, but all back to back, and would last until midnight.

As she was running to the bathroom, Rarity walked up to her again.

"Ooh, Octavia. That was smashing. It's truly amazing the way you can play two songs that long in a row. Although, you were going a little too fast for the first song."

Octavia just giggled nervously, not sure of what to say with all her attention on her desperation.

"I'll be right back," said Octavia, and she ran to the bathroom.

There was yet another line, but these mares didn't look like they needed to pee. Apparently they had eaten some undercooked food at the party, and they each took about ten minutes in the bathroom.

Though there weren't as many ponies in line this time, halfway through the line they had to wait for a pony to replace the toilet paper in there.

"My goodness," said Rarity, taking note of the ponies in front of Octavia rather than her. "I'm sure glad I turned those hay burgers down, I knew they were seriously undercooked."

There was one pony in front of her when the clock struck 11, and, feeling this was getting old and that she might not make it if this kept up, she returned to the fountain and played her next several songs.

She crossed her legs tighter as she played, sweating a little more, but managed to avoid fidgeting.

Somehow she was able to hold it and play relatively well by midnight. There was a five-minute break after that. Getting a sinking feeling this wouldn't be enough, Octavia ran to the bathroom again.

To her delight, there wasn't a line this time. Octavia sprinted, feeling the pee sloshing inside her.

When she tried to open the door, she found it occupied. She felt like cursing at relief being snatched from her at the last second, and, after four minutes, realized she wouldn't be able to pee in time, so she returned to the fountain.

She was so desperate at this time that, especially with the running water from the fountain, she was unable to hide it anymore. As she played her next songs, which, again, were back to back and would go until 1:00, she fidgeted. Some of the ponies noticed this, and gave her weird looks, while others were able to ignore her fidgeting for the songs.

Finally, at 1:00, she got another 10-minute break, but, this time the bathroom was out of order, because someone had clogged the toilet.

When she got back to playing, she fidgeted even harder.

The whole night continued this way - every time she got a break something kept her from getting to the bathroom, even though it had been fixed quickly it was still occupied. As the night went on, and Octavia became more desperate, she started playing her songs a little faster, and occasionally missing a few more notes.

Finally, at 6:00 AM, the event was over. Octavia had been holding it for 11 hours and felt like she was about to burst. Tired and desperate, she saw that the bathroom was still occupied, so she decided to go back home to Ponyville and find her relief there.

She ran to the train, feeling the pee sloshing around in her, but hoping its bathroom would still be fixed. However, the train bathroom was still out of order. As the train began moving, Octavia sat and fidgeted for the entire trip.

After the train arrived at Ponyville, Octavia ran home, the weight of carrying her cello making it a little more difficult for her. Just past 6:30, almost at sunrise, Octavia reached her house. Feeling a bit better at the chance of getting her relief, she ran to the bathroom to open the door.

It was locked. Vinyl Scratch was inside it.

"Hurry up in there!" Octavia said, desperately doing the pee dance. "I've been holding it all night and I'm about to wet myself! I can't... hold it... any longer..."

After about a minute, but feeling like an hour to Octavia, the door opened and Vinyl came out. Octavia ran into the bathroom as quickly as she could, locked the door, and sat on the toilet.

"Ahhhhhhhhh..." The relief felt amazing after holding it for so long, not to mention the other kind of relief from not wetting herself, let alone at the event in Canterlot in front of Rarity or Fancy Pants.

Vinyl Scratch's Desperation

It was sunset, and Vinyl Scratch was getting ready for a party that Pinkie Pie organized for tonight. Pinkie had asked Vinyl to be the DJ for the party. So, DJ was getting ready for the party, while Octavia was getting ready for a big event at Canterlot that she was going to play music at.

As night fell, Vinyl arrived at Sugarcube Corner, where the party was taking place.

"Hi!" said Pinkie Pie as soon as she came in the door. "I can't wait to hear the songs you'll play! Want some soda?"

Vinyl accepted the soda, and as soon as she was done, Pinkie offered her more. Vinyl drank about seven cups of soda.

It was about 9:00 when she started to feel the need to pee. But before she had the chance...

"It's time to start playing music for the party!" Pinkie said.

Reluctantly, Vinyl walked over to her record player and started playing the first song, while operating the machine as usual to keep it going the right way.

She had to play five songs in a row, which were about two minutes long. With each song, she felt the pressure in her bladder increase, but she wasn't too desperate yet and was sure she could hold it.

Once she was done, there would be a five-minute break, so she ran to the bathroom.

"Hey Vinyl Scratch," said Rainbow Dash as she walked up to her. "Want some cider?" Applejack had brought a few barrels of cider over for the party in addition to the soda provided by Pinkie.

Vinyl reluctantly accepted and drank it.

"So, wanna hear about my Wonderbolt performance today?" said Rainbow Dash.

Vinyl listened while Rainbow told her story, a little impatient for her to finish so she could get to the bathroom.

Rainbow wasted the entire five minutes with her story, and Vinyl was forced to return to the record player without getting her relief.

Now she had to play songs until 10:00 when she could take another break. As she continued to play the songs, her bladder continued to fill up minute by minute, and she wasn't sure she could hold it.

After what felt like hours, 10:00 came, and once her current song was finished, she'd have a 10-minute break. Unfortunately, there were several ponies in line, many of which had drank too much soda or cider.

Rainbow Dash was right in front of her, frantically doing the pee dance, as opposed to Vinyl who tried to hide her desperation.

"I need to go SO bad!" said Rainbow Dash, who was right in front of her.

"Me too," said Golden Harvest in front of her, while Berryshine, who had drank the most punch, seemed the most desperate.

Vinyl waited her turn, crossing her legs slightly.

By the time Rainbow Dash entered the bathroom, and could be heard sighing on the other side, it was 10:10 PM, so Vinyl was forced to return to her record player.

She played more songs for the next fifty minutes straight, slowly becoming a little more distracted by how badly she needed to pee, but not affecting her performance... yet.

At 11:00, she really needed to go, and noticed there was no line at the bathroom. Though her break was only for five minutes this time, this would be more than enough time.

She was on her way to the bathroom when Pinkie suddenly ran in front of her. Vinyl was startled and almost lost it, but was able to hold it in.

"Want some more soda?" said Pinkie, holding up a big glass of it.

Vinyl reluctantly accepted and drank it.

"Better not drink too much though," said Pinkie. "One time I drank so much soda at a party, and I needed to pee REALLY BADLY! I had to hold it for, SO long!"

Vinyl felt very uncomfortable at Pinkie's descriptive story about her desperation, which only made her need to pee more. She tried crossing her legs so Pinkie would be able to tell she needed to get to a bathroom right away, but Pinkie was oblivious and described how she had just barely made it to the bathroom on time.

Until her five minutes were up, so she held up a hoof and returned to her record player. Next time she'd have to remember to interrupt her story politely so she could make it to the bathroom.

She played more songs until midnight, at the end of which she got another 10-minute break. She needed to pee more than ever, and didn't think she'd be able to hold it for another hour if she didn't find relief now.

To her dismay, there was another line of desperate mares, Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash among them.

"Weren't you just in line two hours ago?" said Pinkie Pie to Rainbow Dash, both of them standing just in front of Vinyl and desperately doing the pee dance.

"I drank so much cider and it all went through me so fast!" said Rainbow. "Ugh... Why couldn't there be more than one bathroom in here?"

"I wish there was too!" said Pinkie, crossing her legs. "I don't think I'm gonna make it..."

Neither did Vinyl, but the floor stayed dry as each pony entered the bathroom and took her sweet time. Just as Pinkie was entering the bathroom, Vinyl's break was over, so once again, she had to return to playing music without getting her turn in the bathroom.

Now Vinyl was really desperate, and couldn't help but fidget, and sometimes mess up the songs slightly.

As the party progressed, Vinyl became more desperate and squirmed harder, no longer caring how many ponies saw her desperate. Pinkie and Rainbow stopped offering her soda and using up her break time, but each break she got the bathroom either had a line too long for her or was occupied by someone who was taking too long. Vinyl did the pee dance as she stood in line each time.

At her 3:00 AM break, Vinyl raced to the bathroom, but found Pinkie in front of it with a plunger.

"Sorry Vinyl Scratch," she said sheepishly. "I clogged the toilet."

By the time Pinkie fixed the toilet, Vinyl was back playing her songs again.

Finally, the party ended at 6:30 AM. Vinyl found the bathroom occupied again so she just ran back to her home to pee in her bathroom. It was almost sunrise now.

Vinyl felt the pee sloshing inside her as she ran, finally reaching her house and running into the bathroom.

She sat on the toilet and began to relieve herself, and about ten seconds later she heard Octavia on the other side of the door.

"Hurry up in there! I've been holding it all night and I'm about to wet myself! I can't... hold it... any longer..."

Vinyl could barely hear Octavia, as she was too focused on the amazing relief she felt.

After about a minute more, Vinyl was done peeing, and exited the bathroom, to which Octavia immediately ran in, Vinyl truly becoming aware for the first time that she must have been as desperate as her. Had she been holding it in the entire night too? She could hear her sigh on the other side of the door, and was thankful that they both made it.
