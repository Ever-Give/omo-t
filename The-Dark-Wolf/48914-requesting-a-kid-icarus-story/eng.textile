I'd do this myself, but I'm not a great writer and now my stories are seeming too rushed even for here due to my writer's block. (Though some have still considered them to be fun)

Besides, I mainly know about the characters through Super Smash Bros., I've never actually played Kid Icarus: Uprising so I don't know how to write them. But I do know both characters in question are playful to some extent.

I was thinking of a holding contest between Palutena and Phosphora. In their usual outfits, and ending with both of them wetting themselves. (The idea I had in mind if I wrote it would be, and anyone who answers this request can go with it if they want: Palutena wins (I'm sure everyone will cheer for her cause from what I can tell, she's more likeable) when Phosphora wets her shorts all the way, Palutena races to the bathroom but Phosphora blocks her with her speed and tickles her into wetting her dress. They both laugh it off afterwards.)
