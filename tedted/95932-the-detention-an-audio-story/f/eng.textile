I've tried to make this as immersive as possible. Listen on a pair of headphones for the full effect.

As always, contains female desperation, wetting and themes of a sexual nature. This is a work of fiction and any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental. Enjoy!

What software do you use for this?

It’s all edited in audacity. The voice synth stuff is a mix of tools I’ve created myself. There are a lot of websites offering similar services though, play.ht is pretty good.

Very pleasantly surprised by the continuous creation of so many wonderful audio pieces. Could you please share the text of the audio? Thank you.

Thank-you!

Unfortunately, I don't have the text of the audio. When I create these I don't start with a complete script and then convert it to audio. Instead I have a rough idea for a story, and then start generating individual sentences and edit them together. Often I'll find it's impossible to get the audio to sound right for certain bits, so will have to edit the story to fit.

However, a couple of other people have asked for scripts as well, so maybe if I get some free time in the future I'll type them out.
