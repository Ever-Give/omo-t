Contains female desperation, wetting, bad language and themes of a sexual nature. This is a work of fiction and any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental. Enjoy!

Very Nice! This sounds so realistic, much like those 4D surround sound ambiance videos you can find on youtube.

Is this something you made yourself? Are there more audios like this?

Very well done and sounds very realistic! Are there written versions of this story and the previous one? Might be useful for the people who find it easier or more comfortable to read than to listen.

Thanks. I could maybe create the scripts, but I don't have a written story equivalent. Happy for someone else to do one though.
