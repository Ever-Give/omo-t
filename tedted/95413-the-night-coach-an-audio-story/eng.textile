Contains female desperation and humiliation. This is a work of fiction and any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental. Enjoy!

Keep them up! Each of these have been a home-run. Thanks for the work.

Would be interested in paid commissions for audio adaptations of stories on the site (End of the Line, etc.) if thatâ€™s something that interests you. Either way, good job!

Thanks! I'm not in a position to do paid commissions though I'm afraid.

However I really like the idea of trying to do an audio version of an existing story at some point. Also please feel free to suggest ideas or themes for these characters in future stories. I can't make any promises, but I'd be interested to hear what sort of thing people would be interested in.
