Excuse my English, I'm from Chile, I used google translator XD

I have a friend who drinks several bottles of water a day and so has many stories to share with you.

The first story I will tell you the title "Visiting Grandma"

Catalina, the main character in the stories, traveling to see his grandmother who lived far away, she was on a bus with her brother, as she always drank a two-liter bottle, but even she had to go to the bathroom.

After a long journey she met her grandparents who were waiting, went to lunch and asked if they had to go to the bathroom, because the trip was long, but she said no, while traveling she began to feel that his bladder was full, but could stand up to the grandparents' house, the trip was made eternal, crossed her legs, touched down there and looking out the window to distract, worked somewhat, but she was the limit of wetting herself, after an eternal journey was fast to the house, but did not know that the bathroom was broken, and she could not take anymore, so went to tour the countryside of his grandparents, and find a place away where I can pee quiet, far from the house under his pants, and reached down her panties.

She looked to see if anyone was close, but no.

I let out a stream, listening all nature, relaxed, she was alone in the world, no matter what, sighing, feeling a great relief, but at the same shame, but it is the first time you do that and not be the last (then I say to you), returned to see if anyone was near, dried her pussy, got their panties, pants and returned home without telling anyone anything.

This story is based on real events but I will add details, perhaps after another to tell them that she tells me
