A harsh lesson for the newbie:

Vampires have a habit of hibernating in their coffins whenever tragedy strikes, so that they may rise again at a more opportune era...

Unfortunately, this newbie is unfamiliar with such a concept and as such she had to urgently return to her coffin after a very long night of drinking and partying. The rest of the vampire order were disappointed at her lack of forethought and planning. Knowing that she would undoubtedly ruin her place of hibernation by voiding her bladder after all she had consumed at that congregation, they saw it fit to take preemptive measures and punish her at the same time:

Just a few moments before she stepped into her coffin, the order picked her up and dressed her - or rather, mummified her - in tight, completely impermeable latex and leather, ensuring that she would be unable to leave until the rest of the order awakens.

Should she leak, it would not soil the padded surface of her resting place, though of course that meant it would instead just pool inside her "clothes", but the order saw it as a good punishment and as a very good way to train the young vampire on how to control her bladder like refined lady should!

For the first 50 years of her sleep, she held strong, but soon it became too much, she suddenly came awake, squirming frantically as she felt her overfull bladder stretching to contain it all. Worse yet, her garments completely bound her, not even allowing her to place her hands on her aching crotch.

"Help! Help!! Someone get me out, I can't hold it anymore!" - She begged, but all that came out were whimpers, as her garments covered her mouth completely and muffled her voice.

Even if her whimpers could be heard outside the coffin, they would fall on deaf ears, the rest of the vampire order, - much more experienced in hibernation - was in a deep sleep now, oblivious to the newbie's pleas as they dreamed and gathered their strength.

And so, unable to even grab herself to try pointlessly holding back the inevitable... She leaked, a small spurt managed to push through her tired sphincter, with these completely impermeable garments, that little drop that leaked out would not be absorbed, it instead rolled down her tightly clenched privates, tickling it gently as it brushed against her soft, pale skin...

That tickling sensation almost immediately pushed the poor lady over the edge once more, she leaked again, and again, and again until she started to let out a steady, hissy stream of urine into her garments which would pool over the impermeable leather and latex, spreading and sloshing around inside, soaking every inch of her thin legs, her round and firm posterior, her neatly trimmed pubic area... The liquid would remain fully contained, not a drop would escape her leather and latex prison, and it would only continue to rise up her back, as she was powerless to stop her bladder as the urine flooded up to her cute, perky breasts.

She whimpered again, that warmth, the wetness... It embraced her and caused discomfort, she could feel it sloshing around and splashing against her skin, she felt disgusting. She tried to yell out again hoping one last time that the order might hear her muffled pleas...

Of course, nobody came.

Now she lies there, resting in a pool of her urine as a punishment for her foolish partying.

Still, she takes solace in the fact that in 50 more years, the order will wake up and free her from this warm, wet, ammonia scented prison.

"I just have to wait a little longer..." - She thinks - "They'll let me out after the crysis has passed! 50 more years, I can hold the rest of my pee until then... Right?"

...

Let's all hope for her sake that no Vampire Hunters find out where the order is hiding...
