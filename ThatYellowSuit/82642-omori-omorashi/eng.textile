This was pretty good!

I just wish omori had more omorashi stories or art, since that's basically non-existent.

I hope you keep up the great work.

Hey thanks! I do plan on making more for this one but it's taking a while. In the mean time though I made a topic for shorter Omori omo stories. The first ones actually out now! Thanks for the kind words and yes, we all need more Omori Omorashi.
