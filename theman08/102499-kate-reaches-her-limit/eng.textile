Kate Reaches Her Limit

Hey everyone, this is the last Kate story I had planned out. It’s a bit long and will probably be a couple parts. I do want to do another one with new characters that goes into messing more. Let me know if you’re interested in that or prefer this, or thoughts in general.

It was midday on a Sunday. I sat alone relaxing, a far cry from last weekends adventures. Kate, now really getting into the swing of things at work, had took the opportunity to get ahead of her weekly tasks as well as catch up with some old school friends. Now that they were done with classes, the girls and her rarely saw each other. Knowing the school would be open and not too crowded on a weekend though, her former study group decided to plan a reunion. A couple “yes’s” and a few “maybes” later, and it was set.

Kate told me she expected to be gone about two hours. Four had gone by since she’d arrived. Although I was sure she was fine, I reached for my phone to check in on her. Right as I started that, I heard the door open. Kate soon walked in, an uncomfortable look on her face. “I did something bad,” she said with an uneasiness in her tone.

Kate woke up later than intended. With thirty minutes until the agreed upon start time, she still lay lazily in bed. As she groggily checked her phone, she became aware of her mistake. She quickly sprung up and made her way to the closet. Discarding her pajamas, Kate was left in nothing but her birthday suit. Her perfect and petite boobs and athletic butt both were left bare to anyone who may have been lucky enough to see. Deciding that wasn’t the most school appropriate outfit, Kate grabbed a white thing, light blue jeans, and red t shirt. Quickly getting dressed, she headed out the door, determined not to be too late.

Since she clearly wasn’t on her A game, Kate decided for a quick coffee to hopefully boost herself going forward. As she pulled in line for the drive through, she clearly wasn’t the only one who had the thought. Four cars sat ahead of her, and another one quickly came behind her. As Kate waited, she came to an unfortunate realization: she’d skipped her morning pee in her haste. She felt her body begin to wake up, and unfortunately this brought her bladder along with it. The situation was far from an emergency, but Kate’s confidence had been shaken by the wet events of the past few weeks. She contemplated leaving the line, but saw she was trapped. “I can hold it,” she said to herself.

As the line slowly moved, Kate allowed a hand to travel for support. She bounced her leg absentmindedly, praying the line would move fast. Had her recent mishaps not happened, Kate would have been unworried. She still sat confident she’d make it, but she’d have felt even better if her muscular ass was surrounded by porcelain rather than denim and leather.

After ten minutes, Kate made it to the window. Despite the urge in her bladder, she ordered a large iced coffee. It made sense in her head-she’d be there for a while and needed to have something to sip on. Plus, she could pee soon anyways. She debated using the store, but decided to wait until school. Those would be cleaner, and the urge wasn’t that bad. As Kate was handed her coffee, the coldness and moisture of the cup sent a spasm to her bladder. Kate jammed her legs together to prevent any mishaps. Gaining control after a few seconds, Kate drove to school. She’d pee right away.

By the time Kate parked, her bladder had reached an 8.5/10. Not leaking or flooding herself, but not far off. As she stood up and grabbed her bags, the need immediately rose above a 9. With a slight legs cross and a sharp breath, Kate kept it under control. She just needed to drop her stuff off and take the short bathroom walk. Had she not peed herself three times in the last few months, including twice the last week, she’d have felt fine. Now a bit of doubt crept in. Kate approached her friends, ready to head to the bathroom momentarily. She saw three girls, Alexis, one of her good friends, Sydney, another friend, and Lynsey, a more friend of a friend that Kate wasn’t a huge fan of. “Kate! Glad you’re here, we have a question for you,” said Sydney. Kate’s heart sank. She wanted to help, but she had to pee, but she was also pee shy. Not wanting to risk anything weird, she spoke up, “Sure, I just need to use the bathroom quick.”

“It’ll only take a second!”

Kate was filled with dread. Did she dare admit she was bursting? She could probably hold it… but what if she didn’t? Any leak would show on her jeans, and her bladder confidence wasn’t high by any means.

“Sorry… I uh… kinda need to go pretty bad. I’ll be right back.”

Kate felt her face burning up. Admitting to her friends how badly she had to go was extremely embarrassing, but she just couldn’t justify the risk. Kate placed her things down and turned around. The bathroom was simply around the corner and down a long hall. As Kate rounded the corner, her relief came into sight. Seeing the bathroom caused her urge to increase again. Kate knew it was mental, but she just couldn’t help it. The time after finals, the tailgate, the car (that didn’t really count), and her laundry room mishap all were on her mind.

It felt like someone was constantly pouring liquid into her bladder. Now a handful of steps from the toilet, Kate felt another wave hit. She no longer told herself she didn’t need to go badly—all her focus was the room ahead. She estimated in about 20 seconds the flood would commence, like it or not. Despite being a few steps away from the bathroom, Kate began undoing her button and zipper. She panicked as her hands began working. This was the cause of her first accident. Had it gone differently, maybe she wouldn’t feel like this right now. Maybe the panic wouldn’t be there. As she tried to slide the button out, her hand slipped. The surprise of that caused a jolt to Kate. Feeling another urge, she crossed her legs as tightly as possible. Unfortunately, this came after a little leak. This couldn’t happen.

Taking a deep breath and focusing her energy. She tried again on the button: Success. She tried the zipper: success. A passerby would now see a glimpse of her white panties, but she didn’t care. Besides, no one was around anyways. She just couldn’t handle any more delays. She reached for the bathroom door and pulled… open. She dashed inside, praying one of the stalls would be open… they all were. Still a few steps from the stall, Kate began to pull her pants down. Had another person been washing their hands, they’d have been greeted by the top half of her butt, but no such person existed.

Kate entered in the stall and immediately locked it. Pulling her pants just below her knees, she turned around and sat. The sound of her stream filled the room, only accompanied by a small moan of relief. Any delays and she’d have been soaked. She felt embarrassed about that fact, but also relieved she made it. Well, almost. She looked down to inspect her leak. A golf ball sized golden wet patch was present in the crotch of her panties, but nothing showed on her jeans. With a sigh of relief, Kate grabbed a few squares of toilet paper to dry the fabric as best she could. As she finished going, she took a deep breath and wiped herself clean. It had been an eventful morning, and she was ready to get to work.

Thank you! I’m hoping to this next week, but if not hoping the week after. It will depend on schedule!

Here is the next chapter. It’s not as intense as the other ones, but that’s coming. Hope you enjoy.

With her bladder emptied, Kate composed herself and approached her friends. She hated when people knew she’d used the bathroom, so she felt awkward as she came into view. She tried to play it off normal, “hey everyone, what can I help you with?” she asked, hoping to steer the conversation in her direction. “Lynsey is taking an extra class just on contracts to get prepared for the topic,” said Sydney, “we got it though.” Kate nodded, understandingly. “Besides, it didn’t seem like as much of an emergency as your bladder was,” piped Lynsey, “you practically sprinted out of here… did you make it?” she said with a laugh. Kate felt her face burn up. She was sure she turned red with embarrassment. Was it that obvious she had to go so badly? She felt like she had to play it off somehow, saying “Yea I did.

And sorry about that, I hadn’t gone today and the urge just kind of hit me.” Lynsey laughed again, “well, it’s a good thing you didn’t have this outfit on. If you did, your boyfriend would probably be bringing you new clothes right now,” she said gesturing to her outfit with a hint of meanness in her voice. This is why Kate was never a huge fan of Lynsey— she just always seemed a bit mean and nasty. Kate herself was pretty innocent and sweet, and most of her friends were too. Maybe Lynsey just thought it was funny, but interactions like these weren’t uncommon, and it certainly wasn’t something Kate wanted to hear right now. Despite this, Kate would never tell her off or anything. She’d just hope it went away or she could joke it off.

Kate also thought about what Lynsey said about the outfit. Lynsey wore a light blue floral romper that tied in the back and was pretty tight all around. She may not have liked Lynsey, but she knew there was no denying she was an attractive woman. With flowing blonde air, a round ass with muscle from her days as a volleyball player, and boobs that were probably a C cup. Kate wished she had a body like that, but she also knew she was by no means unattractive. She just wasn’t on the level of Lynsey, where guys would routinely hit on her at bars and in school. From her time with Lynsey, she knew she had no issue with that development.

Even today, her romper showed ample cleavage, and as Kate looked closer, it seemed like she wasn’t even wearing a bra. An interesting choice, Kate thought. Even though her boobs were right across from Kate, it was on the other side that she couldn’t shake. The tie that Lynsey teased her about, implying that Kate would have had to deal with much worse than a leak had she needed to solve that in her desperate state. The thought worried Kate, but she did her best to put it out of her mind. After all, she wasn’t wearing that outfit, and she did make it. She just felt lucky there were no wardrobe malfunctions this time.

Kate pulled out her laptop and began to work on her upcoming reports and cases. The girls talked among themselves for a bit and caught up on life. All three of her friends found themselves busy with various projects and life work. They commented on the weather and summer, and how it was unseasonably warm out still. “It’s great to see everyone, I cleared my schedule all day for this,” said Alexis. The girls all smiled, “I did too,” added Kate, “it’s great to see you all.” Sydney also pointed out that no one else was in the school, which surprised them a bit. “I guess they aren’t as dedicated as we were and are,” she said. With life catching up to all of them it became harder and harder to see her old friends, so this was a welcome event. As they talked and worked, Kate became thirsty, and reached down to grab her large water bottle. Grabbing it and taking a sip, she felt refreshed.

“Careful, Kate. We don’t want you getting in any more trouble,” she heard Lynsey pipe up. Kate’s ears burned with embarrassment. She was annoyed, but it wasn’t her personality to respond with anger. Instead, she tried to stay calm. “I won’t, thanks. And you guys have those big teas with you,” she said motioning to their drinks. The girls all had a 24 ounce sweet tea from the vending machine in front of them and were sipping them intermittently. “Yea, but we don’t have those issues. Plus they’re so good,” Lynsey responded. Shrugging off “those issues,” Kate just dropped the conversation and continued working.

After about 45 minutes of working, Kate felt her bladder begin filling. As she reached for her cup, she realized why— she’d already finished her 24 ounce water. This was pretty quick, but not a huge surprise. She tended to mindlessly sip when she worked, and the weather was warm in general. Between that and her coffee from earlier, it wasn’t a shock it filled up this quickly. The urge wasn’t bad yet, but she didn’t want to find herself in another tricky situation. However, she also didn’t want to get up so quickly and draw attention to herself and her bladder. She decided to hold for a bit longer and work some more, her shyness getting the better of her.

As Kate kept on reading, she couldn’t get her mind totally off her bladder. The pangs of it in the back of her mind stayed present no matter how hard she tried to focus elsewhere. She began tapping her leg to try and get her mind off of it, but it was useless. She had to pee. She wouldn’t do good work until she did. There was no hope of waiting long enough that no one would notice. Gathering her courage Kate began to rise. She pulled her phone out in unison, hoping to maybe have her friends say nothing. “You okay?” asked Alexis. Damn, Kate thought. “Yea, I just need to use the bathroom quick,” she said quietly. “Didn’t you just go?” Lynsey asked with a chuckle. Kate sighed. She knew it looked weird. She wished she could hold forever, but she couldn’t. “Yea, I did,” she replied, “but I finished my water and coffee. I’ve been trying to stay hydrated.” Sydney and Alexis barely acknowledged it, sensing that Kate wasn’t proud of it.

“Well don’t let us stop you then, we know it can be tight,” said Lynsey, again with a hint of meanness. Kate was annoyed at her comment, but moved past it. Approaching the bathroom with much less stress than last time, Kate opened the door to find it empty again. Going in the same stall as last time, she undressed and sat down. Her stream softly trickled down before soon picking up with more power. As Kate relaxed, she was surprised by how much she held. As lame as it sounded, it felt good for her to have a time where her bladder was full, but she wasn’t desperate. She enjoyed her time with the group, even if Lynsey was getting on her nerves. She could shrug it off for now, and maybe she was just trying to be funny, Kate thought to herself. Roughly 30 seconds had passed since Kate first sat, and she felt her stream begin to die off. With a quick wipe and flush, she redressed, and headed towards the group.

Part of me does hope we also get to see Lynsey desperate and getting a little comeuppance. Great story so far!
