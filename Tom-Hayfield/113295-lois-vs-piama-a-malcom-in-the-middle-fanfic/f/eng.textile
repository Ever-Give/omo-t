Lois Vs. Piama - A Malcom In The Middle Fanfic

Salt. It had all started over salt.

Malcolm, Reese, Dewey, Francis and Hal had fled the house as the argument between Lois and Piama escalated from light bickering into full-scale shouting. Everyone knew both their tempers ran hot and today; as both had agreed to work together on cooking dinner, everyone had feared a disastrous confrontation.

They were right to be afraid.

“You are being completely unreasonable! You salt the chicken, tenderise and cook. What’s so hard to understand?!”.

“No, you tenderise, cook and salt at the end, to add the kick of flavour!”.

“That’s absurd!”.

“I’m not taking any advice from you, a grown woman who pees her pants!”.

“I… I did that for a good reason!” snarled Lois. “I won the truck!”.

“Yeah, where the hell is that thing? I haven’t seen it in ages”.

“We sold it”.

“Huh. That was quick”.

“Look, stop getting off track! The point is, I did what I did for a good reason, as any responsible mother would in my shoes!”.

Piama shook her head in disbelief.

“Wow. You really believe that?”.

“Oh I don’t believe sister” stepping close to Piama; arms at her hips. “I know it to be true”.

“Please. All you did was outlast a bunch of losers. It's not like you could do that against someone with actual strength”.

“Oh, what; like you?!” asked Lois in disbelief.

“Yeah, like me!”.

“Ridiculous”.

“What, too scared to challenge me?”.

The look Lois gave Piama was one that would have given Malcolm nightmares for weeks and caused Reese to begin having seizures around certain female teachers. Piama gulped, trying to hide her nerves.

“I fear no one and certainly not you, Missie”.

Unwilling to be pushed around, Piama feigned confidence.

“Alright then, up for a little challenge?”.

“Name it”.

“You and me, a holding contest. Right here, right now. We empty our bladders, then we fill these to the top with water and whoever cracks first is the loser for all eternity”.

“Oh, is that so? Give me that. This shouldn’t take long. My pelvis has survived multiple childbirths, sweetheart. It’ll survive a full bladder”.

“You’re old, I’m young and; to be honest, much better looking. You haven’t got a chance”.

“Ooh, you little…”.

Within minutes, both women had used the bathroom and now stood opposite each other, holding two litre jugs that were full to bursting; staring daggers into the other’s eyes. Lois was wearing a pink sleeveless top with tight white jeans, while Piama was dressed in tight blue jeans and a red jumper with the top buttons undone; ever-so-slightly exposing her cleavage.

“You ready?” asked Piama, challengingly.

“Bring it” retorted Lois.

Both women began downing the jugs of water, pouring huge amounts of liquid directly in their bodies; while splashing the remainder over their jobs, turning both of their shirts see-through and exposing that neither was wearing a bra. Once they had finished the jugs, both slammed them down and stared towards the other confidently.

“I don’t even feel it”.

“Like a drop in the ocean”.

38 MINUTES LATER…

Lois’s legs were tightly criss-crossed, hands swaying on her hips as she breathed in and out; repeatedly, trying to relieve the pressure, yet it only seemed to get worse with every second. Her bladder was now bulging, pushing out the waistband of her white pants and it was taking everything Lois had not to leak, knowing how quickly any such thing would show up on the front.

“Oh god, this hurts” she moaned angrily.

Meanwhile, Piama was faring no better. Pacing on the spot, she paused every few seconds to do a desperate pee-dance, her knees bending and shaking, hands shoved between her legs, trying to give her overfilled bladder even the smallest amount of relief from the incredible weight it now carried. It wasn’t working.

“Whose idea was this?!”.

“Yours!”.

Piama groaned as the two ladies continued to writhe, dance and squirm, using every trick they knew to continue holding themselves; safe in the knowledge their loved ones wouldn’t be back anytime soon. In fact, at that exact moment, Hal was discussing roller-skating with a biker gang in Chuck E Cheese, Malcolm was over analysing a girl at school’s love note (Wrong locker) and Reese was working on a scheme to invent a new kind of chocolate. Dewey and Francis had; unbeknownst to all, become trapped in a line of runaway shopping carts and wouldn’t be seen for several hours.

In short, the two women were alone for the rest of the day.

“God, give me the strength to beat this woman and I swear, you’ll see me at church twice as often! Three times as often! I’ll go every day if I have to!” pleaded Lois.

“That’s not fair, you can’t ask for outside help!”.

“Says who?!”.

“Says me!”.

The two women began to bicker again for several moments and this was a fatal mistake. Completely distracted, Piama suddenly cried out; her stomach gurgling.

“Oh god! I think… I think it's coming!”.

Lois laughed triumphantly.

“Ha! Too bad! You mess with the best, you…”.

Suddenly, Lois’s bladder contracted; her laughing having weakened her muscles at a critical moment.

“Oh no… not now! Not now!”.

Both women looked each other straight in the eyes, filled with emotion: Pride, anger, fear, hate and finally, despair. Their next words were identical:

“I can’t hold it!”.

Lois moaned loudly in relief as her bladder finally gave away and a large wet spot formed on the crotch of her white trousers, quickly expanding and spreading down her legs. Her underwear offered no meaningful resistance, the dark black soaking through in an instant as pee flooded onto the floor; surrounding Lois in a pool of shame and humiliation. At the same moment, thick wet streaks quickly ran down the insides of Piama’s tight blue jeans, the warm wetness spreading around her butt and flooding the front of her jeans.

Both women had lost control and were completely wetting themselves, standing in evergrowing puddles that; under any circumstance, would have left them crying, raging or fleeing in their own defence. However, today, both women remained in place, shivering from the release as their bodies gave in to their overwhelming need. Previously in immense pain, both women shuddered from the bliss of release and their clits thrummed against the hot wetness. Lois bit her lip to keep from whimpering. Piama openly moaned.

“Did you just…”.

Lois tailed off, for once falling silent as Piama looked back to her; the two women now more turned on than they had been in their entire lives. Both had endured accidents before but never so intimately or with so much force, never after holding so much and never while they were otherwise alone; leaving their minds to run wild with all the possibilities of the moment. Both knew that what they were feeling, what they wanted next, would betray those closest to them. At any other time, they would have listened to their brains and done the sensible thing.

Yet today, they did something new.

Lois and Piama met in the middle of the room, locking each other in a tight embrace, their tongues battling for dominance as their competitive streaks remained; even as the last of their pee flooded down over their shoes. Piama ran her hands through Lois's hair, while Lois’s fingers in turn slipped down to Piama’s wet bum, gripping at the soaked fabric. Their bodies grinded against each other, drenched clothes pressed tight against trembling skin as both took their time in exploring the other.

Piama unbuttoned Lois’s soaked white trousers, exposing her black panties as the older woman’s trousers fell to her knees. Sliding two fingers over her underwear, she began to rub over them, gently at first; then faster and faster with each moment. Lois moaned, loudly, sinfully; feeling more turned on than she ever had with Hal. Caught in the younger woman’s passions, her own desires came roaring to the surface and she picked Piama up; wrapping the younger woman’s legs around her waist, before carrying her to the nearby sofa.

Both fell onto it with breathless moans as Lois took the lead, pinning Piama down and stripping off her wet clothing; piece-by-piece, as she helplessly and delightedly squirmed beneath her. Eventually releasing the grip on her hands, this was only to move down her body; pulling off her underwear and jeans, revealing her piss-soaked legs and drenched pussy beneath.

“Are you sure this is what you want?” asked Lois, her insecurities emerging in a moment of doubt as she looked for any sign of hesitation, of worry; any hint she might face rejection or rebuke for everything that had just happened.

“Don’t stop!”.

Lois smiled, before her tongue began to run across the younger girl’s clit, rolling her gently within her mouth. Piama moaned, loudly, her legs trembling; her whole body shaking, yet Lois held her in place. The older woman’s strength was so much greater than she realised and Lois read Piama’s body like an open book, finding all her sweet spots, all her danger zones, moving across her pee-soaked busy with the skill of a pro and driving her; quickly, to an enormous release.

“Lois… I’m going to… I…”.

“Cum for me, sweetie. Cum now”.

Those words of permission sent Piama over the edge and she screamed with delight, her whole body convulsing as she experienced one of her most powerful orgasms ever; squirting into Lois’s face as her muscles simultaneously came undone under the skilled older woman’s masterful oral. Each wave of pleasure seemed to only bring on a new peak and Piama felt tears roll down her face, utterly overwhelmed by the raw bliss she had just experienced.

“Still think I’m an old woman with nothing to learn from?” asked Lois sarcastically, as Piama breathed heavily with delight.

“I was wrong” she admitted. “I was so wrong”.

Lois grinned, savouring the feeling of victory and yet, it was exactly this distraction that allowed Piama to catch her off-guard; legs twisting Lois’s body so she was now the one laying back against the sofa; with Piama on-top. Surprised by her boldness, Lois could only stare in astonishment and then excitement as Piama pulled off the older woman’s trousers and piss-drenched underwear; along with her shirt, leaving Lois as naked as Piama was.

“Well, here it is” said Lois, gesturing to her body. “Try not to look so disappointed”.

“I’m not” said Piama honestly, sultrily. “You’re beautiful”.

Lois gasped with surprising emotion, tears coming to her eyes as Piama’s tongues slid over her soaking wet folds; drenched with pee and arousal. Though nowhere near as experienced as her, Piama’s tongue and fingers moved with a speed and passion that she couldn’t replicate and the passion with which she explored her body, God, Lois felt as if she were in her prime again. Piama’s touch made her feel excited, alive; utterly captivated, in a way that Hal never had and now, she felt the tension within her building. There was a knot of pleasure forming within her stomach, growing tighter and tighter every moment, until; she knew, it would inevitably snap. When it did, Lois would lose all control and she could scarcely believe how quickly the younger woman was bringing her to the edge of her best orgasm in decades.

Her legs soaked in piss, her marital vows forsaken and the young woman’s tongue passionately writhing through her body with such force, passion and desire, Lois knew the end was near and her screams filled the house as; finally, the last of her control gave out and she began to squirt violently, drenching Piama with twice as much fluids as the young woman had soaked her in. Piama didn’t stop fucking her during the entire process, her tongue teasing Lois’s clit as two fingers slid in and out of her; sending Lois into convulsive fits of pleasure that, finally, came to a gentle halt as the two lay together in each other’s arms.

For a while, neither spoke; content in the other’s company, not wanting to interrupt this rare moment of serenity in their hectic lives. Surprisingly, for a woman who long been known as ‘The Mouth’, it was Piama who spoke first:

‘Well, I guess Francis and I might as well have children now. After this, I’m not afraid of changing diapers anymore!”.

Lois looked towards her; incredulous. Then, both women started laughing.

“Well… you’re welcome for dinner again, anytime!”.

“I may just take you up on that”.

“Good” grinned Lois, before frowning as she remembered something.

“What is it?”.

“Salt still comes first though”.
