Hello I've noticed this site and many others have Omorashi stories and Diaper stories, but that these two tend to have almost zero overlap which I quite frankly find bizarre. I've also found that when combined these two fetishes almost always have magical realism elements, which I find sorely lacking in all omorashi/diaper stories. I don't want you're weird fantasy universe, I want a realistic setting with a bit of unexplained magic. (like an all knowing nanny, or never ending bathroom line)

I've found a few others like Princess Pottypants who have overlapped elements of these two fetishes but I was wondering if you, the fine people knew of any other authors who dabbled in this genre? I've found a few others with stories like this but they almost always feature men which I don't find appealing.

Stories where a full grown women is suddenly struggling with keeping her pants dry, and is slowly demoted to diapers. Stories about adults failing toilet training. I'd love any suggestions you might have, realistically I'd take any stories involving women, diapers and omorashi.
