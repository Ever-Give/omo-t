Question about the new policy

1.) Does "abuse" include spanking or bondage?

2.) Does the thing about minors include anime girls? Technically just about any anime girl you ever see is under 18 (though they look like they could be like 18-20's even if they're in junior high school) and sometimes they get fetishized and stuff in the shows themselves.

And speaking of that, does that apply to fictional characters in live-action who are physically played by real actors? If this and my second question about animated characters are now forbidden, that practically bans most fanfiction, except ponies.
