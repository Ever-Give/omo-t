I came across an omorashi novella about a few couples who love to wet and pee their beds, how they meet and learn to trust one another. It's called A Pinch of Salt by Mildred Downs. All the character's lives change for the better after parties and other adventures. A good long read with plenty of details.

It's been a while since a book has been devoted to all aspects of our fetish. Also, the characters are middle aged, and for some, sex is a bit more complicated than falling into bed. Wetting at work is addressed as well.

I saw it on Amazon Kindle and on the publisher's site, abdiscovery.com.au

I'd give it 41/2 stars.
