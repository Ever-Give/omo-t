A dark day overshadowed by its own achievements

The on lookers watched as the stage lights flickered to life unaware of the truth hidden deep beneath the hard earth they stood on.

The man began waltzing about the recently nconstructied wood platform it would be gone as soon as it appeared.

He spoke not only to the large crowd he so skillfully baited but to himself “its foolproof” he thought

“now now” his voice billowed from the speakers “i have a plan... one to change the world..... forever “

That last word never meant much before

The crowd screamed for more this man was a genius biggest tech manufacturer in the city normally he went on about his newest phone or some computer thats name is worth more then it abilities

But not today...
