Hi all,

I couldn’t remember whether I have seen it here or some older BBS. The story is about an extremely long hold by a female cycling girl. The story begins with the girl wins some sort of marathon in cycling and the guy was interviewing her. After that there’s training and other extremely long hold scenes, lastly they were flying to Chicago.

Thank you all so much for helping, have been looking for it but found none.

The story you're referring to was written by Peter-P, and is called Tour de France. He used to have an account here, but it seems to have been deleted.

I think I may have a copy of it somewhere on one of my backup drives, but I'd have to look. Are we allowed to post other people's stories?
